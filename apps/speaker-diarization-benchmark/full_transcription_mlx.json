  "text": " Hello? Can't handle the tech. This tech is off the fucking hook. Hello? Hi, how are you? Good. I was looking on the internet and I saw you were selling a mannequin. I don't know, what's the, what's telling me more? You're not selling a mannequin? No, I've recently sold some forms, but I can't think of one that I have listed right now. Ah, shoot. It says it says Glenn Eagles at the bottom of it. That is a picture of a mannequin. That's a mannequin, yes, I am selling that, yes. You're selling a picture of it or the actual mannequin? The actual mannequin. Okay, so I have a few questions about the mannequin. This one? It looks here like it has a very nice feminine physique. Would you say that it has a nice bust? Yes. Okay. No, no, it's kind of flat-tested actually. Oh boy. What would you say? Like sea cups? I don't know. I don't know. Well, I'm going to need to know that information because this is not going to be a public mannequin anymore. This is going to be in my house. Okay. And I'm going to attach things to it and you do the math. You have to look at it, but it's probably not going to work for you because the mannequin is a promotional mannequin. And that they use and it's actually made out of like a paper mache product. Oh, so it would not support the weight of a man? No. If I were to lay on it from behind? It wouldn't work. No. You have to keep looking. Okay. Well, thank you very much and keep up the good... Well, if you get your hands on a hard one with a good, smooth... Okay. Well, thank you. Good morning, brother. How you doing? Hey, what's going on? How you feeling, man? Great. Welcome to Matt and Shane's secret podcast. Welcome to the secret podcast. Top secret stuff going on over here, including the launch of a brand new podcast. Oh, my God. Inaugural episode. This is the very first episode. This is big time, dude. History. This is history. I give it five episodes. How about you? Five is a little ambitious. I think we'll fizzle out after two. I think we're going to get a lot of bad reviews after one. Probably. Maybe give it a shot again and realize that podcasting is not for us. But for now, this is it. Or this is the best... This is top five all time. This could be exactly. It could be. So, we'll see. But yeah, we're just going to mess around, bust around, call some folks. Actually, we've got a big meeting with Phil Gillis coming up pretty soon. I'm going to have a telephone call with my dad here in a moment. About to get him fired up. He doesn't even know about the secret podcast. Nobody does. Nobody knows. Nobody knows about this. Let's fire up your policy. I've heard some people have some questions. They can tell there's something great happening about the secret podcast. But nobody knows about it. Keep it that way. Let's get Phil Gillis on the line. Alright, let's call him up. Phil Gillis, great. Hey, I'm trying to hold Shane Gillis, actually. ABA Financial Solutions. Yeah, you're here for Shane Gillis? Yeah, we thought this was Shane's number. He's going to now stand in the city of Philadelphia. We're trying to settle on parking. It's expired, PPA. Yeah, he lives in Philadelphia. And this is his parents' house. Ah, got it. Okay. You know how we hold them? It's roughly about $3,400. We're trying to settle on outstanding parking tickets mostly. I was like, I'm going to deposit tickets for $3,400. Yeah, they kind of develop pretty quickly. And then once we take the debt over, we tax something on as a penalty fee. So, yeah. Okay. Well, Remy, can you see where I can hold the security guard? All right, here it comes. Here it comes. Oh, he's going to be so mad. You think he's going to call it? I bet. Oh, no. Just play the waiting game. He's going to get fired up and get you, dude. Yeah, he gets so mad about fucking parking tickets. He handled that one well, though. I thought he was going to stick up for me. And you were like $3,400. And he was like... He told you that real quick. For parking tickets? I know. Well, I threw that interest rate stuff thing. And he was like, this is ridiculous. And he was like, all right, yeah, fuck him. And dude. I should just call him. Maybe. He's like, what's going on? He was like, dude, some guy called for you. Some guy did call for you. All right. Like, why do you have some guy called for you, dude? Because you don't have my parking tickets for your parking tickets. Fuck. Maybe this wasn't a good idea to fuck with this old man. I'm just starting to regret this, dude. He's going to be pissed. I can't believe Chris O'Connor called your dad. Yeah. I'll call him right now. But hey, they called you. Sorry about that. I hear this. Is it recording? Hello? Sose? Yeah? What's going on, man? Well, some company did call me. They're a collection group. You own $3,400 for parking tickets. I thought we paid that. I thought I paid. I just paid those. Remember when I was at the house? I paid those. Thank you. I gave you your cell phone number to talk to you. Yeah, they called me and I was wondering why you fucking sold me out. They sold you out? You fucking sold me out. They wouldn't have been able to fucking contact me. I was fine. You were fine and it was continuing to escalate. Dad, you're being a pussy about this. Come on. They can't. You're nuts. I'm fucking with you, Phil. Okay. No, I mean the whole thing's fine. The fucking phone call was fake. Really? Yeah, that was Matt McCusker. He's sitting right next to me right now. He's being a dickhead, too. So you thought I was going to get all fired up in NSU and this and that? Yeah, you did pretty well. Yeah, I did. Yeah, you did. Hello. You recorded this now and this is going to be go somewhere, right? No. Well, yeah, it is. What do you think about Trump winning? We didn't get to talk about that. Now that I have you on, you're our first guest. Am I? You're the first guest we've ever had on our show. Well, your fucking show's not going to last. Because that was idiotic. Yeah, it wasn't very good. We thought you'd freak out. Now you called me. It's like, get done watching prices right and then have lunch and said, let's go fuck with my bag. So we did. Well. I'm up with something better. That's true. You said you had a joke for me. You called me the other day and said that you had a joke that you thought I could use in my... Timing is everything. That joke is when Trump was visiting Obama in the White House. Is this going to be racist? Absolutely. Oh, shit. Well, let's hear it. The other meeting was supposed to take place and last about 15 minutes. What the... How fucking bored are you? How fucking bored are you that you're just on this fucking show right now? I'm on your show right now. Yeah. Oh, okay. Well, yeah, maybe you should fucking chill with the racism. It's not racist. All right, let's hear it. Let's hear it. I want to give you... Because people who listen to this are going to actually think you are racist, so you're not. Go ahead. Yeah. What I was saying is Trump was supposed to meet with Obama two days after the election, which he did. It was supposed to last about 15 minutes. He was in there for an hour and a half. So after they talk about Obamacare and the international things and building the wall, not building the wall, immigration, things like that, Obama starts to pull out his potton, starts putting on the carpet. And he says, I understand you're into golf. Trump says, well, yeah, in fact, I own a few courses. He says, well, I'd love to play. He says, we... Holy fuck, dad. No. God damn it, Phil. No, man, that's tough. Yeah, that's tough. You're going to get eaten alive on the internet for that. Yeah, no, dad. I have to. This is the best thing we've come up with all day. No, don't. I'm sorry, dad. I'll just keep it. I know you're kidding. You're the best. And I'll see you this weekend. I'll be home. You can catch me and Matt McCusker at the Harrisburg Comedy Zone this weekend. This Friday and Saturday. Phil, what do you think of that? This Friday and Saturday. The Harrisburg Comedy Zone. Let me get a large group of people together, and then you can go and say how you like to 69 with your dad. All right, that's it. That's the fucking end of this conversation. I'll talk to you later, dad. Dag. Dag. The old man gave you the biz. Yeah. As usual. He was not happy about that, that ending there, that what he referenced, the 16th and 19th part, my dad's not a fucking pervert. That was me. He was referencing a joke I did. In front of him. In front of him. Family and friends. Family and friends while bombing. I tossed out this fucking Hail Mary at the end of it about what would you rather do? Would you rather get shot in the head or 69 with your dad? Dadio did not like that. And the old man and my mom, and they invited family friends. The Osborns? The Osborns. The Osborns were there. They got to watch, they got to watch their good friend's son flounder and then toss out a joke about 69-ing with their fucking friend. Well, also the impending threat of a gun to the head makes it all that more violent and disturbing. It's like some weird, soul fantasy. Now you've got to suck your way out of it. Yeah. And the amplifier too is you have to. You both have to finish. Exactly. That's the horrific, that's more scarier than the gun. You both have to finish. So this could take hours. Yeah. Hours straight of just you and your dad's 69-ing. It's like sore necks and clenched jaws. Both sounding like two old wives to each other like, do you next tired? So I was, yeah, I had a show in town in Harrisburg and my parents were excited. They haven't seen me do stand-up in a while. They thought they're, I moved to Philadelphia. They're like, man, he's really, he's really working on becoming a good stand-up comic. And then they got to watch me bomb for like 10 minutes and toss that one out. And the funny thing was is everyone in the audience knew me. So it was all like my friends and shit from high school and like, they all knew my dad too. And they all knew he was sitting in the fucking front row in the middle of the front row. And they just got to watch me say that and crumbled. I crumbled on stage when I said it to my mom yelled my mom yelled and I thought it'd be funny to tell her to shut the fuck up. So you told your mom to shut the fuck up and you proceeded to implant the visual of you and your father 69-ing in front of the Osborns to the whole party was fucking hilarious. Did they try to put together? I don't think that had been so funny. They just drove home in silence. Your parents and the Osborns. They just said, you're a good boy. You got a good boy. Cats and the Cradle comes on the fucking radio. Now that was, I don't know, I think it's funny that they drove separate because as soon as the Osborns got in the car, they must have been like, holy fuck. Something's wrong with that boy. That kid is fucking weird. He's a weird boy. That is a weird dude. I just imagine, forgive me if I'm wrong, but just like an older lady, a mature older lady with one of those blanket shirts, just like a blanket draped over in big costume jewelry, all excited to go out with her husband, Mr. Osborn. No, they were fucking pretty hip actually. Are they? Yeah, they're a wealthy bunch, successful. We do accept donations on the cast. Mrs. Osborn's always nice to me. Really? Like every time I see her, she like hugs me. She's like, Shayne! And now... I'm sure they don't care. That's the other thing. I wonder about that sometimes, but like, they've heard horrible shit. I think that's gotta be the worst thing they've ever seen. Yeah, that's true too. It's a different way of joking. People don't joke about that back then. No, nobody jokes like that. People still don't. I'd say that joke sometimes, but people get like mad. If I grabbed my dad's ass, he'd fight me. Like if my dad would fight me, he doesn't kid around like that. No, they don't fuck around. One time my dad tried to fight me because I downwipped my mom. He whipped her in the towel. I got out of the bathroom and he had a towel and he fucking towel whipped me in the face. He hit me in the fucking face as soon as I opened the door. So I grabbed the fucking towel and started chasing him. And we started 69. No, and I started chasing him. You sounded like a man do. And he fucking hid behind my mom. Like it was fun. It was a nice moment. We never fuck around like that. Yeah. And I was like, Joan, my mom, I was like, you better fucking move. I'm going to do this. I better get out of the way. She was like, I'm not going to move. And I fucking did it. And I'm normally terrible at towel whipping. For a high school bully, I'm pretty. That's one of my weaknesses. As a bully, I was always terrible at towel whipping. And out of nowhere, you just in perfect. Joan's your mom. Perfect fucking whip crack, dude, right there. And my dad switched from fun dad. Like he treated me like I wasn't a son. He treated me like just some random dude. He got in my fucking face and was like, you fucking pussy. You want to fucking hit your mother, you fucking soft bitch. It was like, oh God. Oh, you guys are like two strangers at a bus stop. My mom cried. Did you really? It was that fucking. That was the hard the whip was. Yeah. Oh man. She cried from that. And then my dad tried to fight me and he lost his shit. It was crazy. How the, what was the physical interact? Did you just block him off or like? Yeah, I was fucking just shelled up, dude. I covered up. He had me by the fucking scruff. Really? Yeah. Dude, I'd love to see your dad jack you up. Yeah. He's tried to fight me a couple of times over nothing. Like one time he was talking to me. It was me and my girlfriend were in the kitchen with him. And he was telling me that I need to sell my car. And I was like, dad, I'm not going to get shit for that. And he was like, oh yeah, you're going to get that. And I was like, dad, I fucking sell cars. I know what that's going to sell for. I've looked it up and I was like, I sell cars, you sell fucking. I made fun of what he does for a living. He fucking freaked out. He tried to fight me in front of my girlfriend. Oh my God. And then like 10 minutes later he came back and was like, I'm sorry. Oh my God. Yeah, that was so the 69 year dad thing. That was a. He didn't like it. Fuck no. And he called you the next day to tell you that called me the next day and said, he's like, well, first time he called me, I was like, if this is about you giving me stand up advice, because after the show, I was fucking hammered after the show. And he came up and was like, that show fucking sucked. He was like, that really sucked. And then he just left. My mom didn't talk to me. Oh, that's a double dagger. That's a small dagger in the back, dude. The mom silence. Yeah, it was bad. I mean, it was. I knew what I was doing. Like I knew. Seeing a guy up there talking to his dad about 69 with him and then screaming at his mom like, shut the fuck up mom. She yelled no, I knew it was fucking fun. Like if I saw someone else do it, I'd be howling and like crying laughing, but I did it. And so he was upset. He called me the next day and was like, right when I answered the phone, I was like, if this is about stand up, I'm not going to fucking talk to you. I don't want to hear your fucking advice on stand up. And he was like, all right, all right. So I hung up. I think I was there when you hung up on him. And like 20 minutes later, I called him and I was like, all right, what the fuck? What? What is it? And he was like, uh, oh no, you tell me. What do you think about that show? I was like, oh fuck. I was like, it sucked. I know, but that joke's not that bad. I was like, it's a good joke. You got to give it a chance. And yeah, he was just like, why can't you be like the other guys? Why can't you do stand up like the other everybody else was having fun telling stories and jokes. You're up there talking about, I don't even want to say what you're talking about. But yeah, that's, that's the tough one. It's a tough call to field from the dead. Yeah. That's anytime, but then Tommy, I was with Tommy Pope and he just laid some decent. He was like, if your, if your parents like your stand up chances are you fucking suck. I was like, all right, nice. That is true though. Yeah. It is. Unless you have like super cool parents in which case usually they turn out pretty weird. You know what I mean? If your parents are too cool. Yeah. Like, yeah, dude, 69 minutes. It's hilarious. It's like your dad's a fucking weirdo. Yeah. Yeah. So if my dad understood why that was funny, that would be odd. He did the right thing to be able to make a living. He was doing the right thing. Yeah. It'd be doing a fucking podcast right now. Yeah, exactly. Your dad's probably potting right now. His podcast is probably sick. His podcast. His podcast is so fucking good. Day by night. Day by night. All day. Feelgillus experience. He'd just be sitting there talking about lines of like Arizona state versus fucking San Diego state. Oh my God. That'd be awesome. San Diego state's getting 30. That's a good take. That's all his picks. We should call him for his, for his Stone Cold blocks. That's not bad. It's also a nice little bit we can throw in here. Hell yeah. Little sports, little sports bit. Dude, I love it. I love to see who he's taking the week every Sunday. Check him, call him, big yo bro. Yeah, you were wrong. Get a couple dogs this week. Send a couple dogs to the track. Yeah, we should call, we should also call my cousin Frankie. Yeah. Ask him about Notre Dame. Get him fired up. See who he thinks about what the Irish are doing in football. Shit. Cause that guy is a monster. He wore a fucking Purdue windbreaker to his brother's wedding. Damn. Full fucking windbreaker. Damn. Windbreaker suit to his brother's wedding. What an athlete. Oh, that was another fucking bomb I took. So my cousin Jeff got married and he was like, you want to do a little stand up at the reception? Stand up at the fucking reception. I was like, all right, let me know. Shit. No planning at all. How long? Did you do? Oh, I did. Like, well, what happened was I showed up late to the reception. Like I was real late. So I was like, all right, good. I fucking missed that doing stand up at his wedding. I missed that. So right when I walk in, right when I walk in, they're like, oh, he's here. Shane, why don't you come up? I walked in right during the speeches and all that shit. It's like, why don't you come here and do a couple of minutes of stand up? It sucks. And my cousin's wife was pretty nice. Like she's a good person. What the fuck are you up to? Taking your chicken out of the oven? Yeah. Now I got to tell the story to no one. So I walked in. Yeah, this is fucking weird. Yeah, it kind of is. All right. So she's like a nice person. So all her side of the family was like real quiet and nice. And my side is a bunch of fucking idiots. So I didn't do stand up. I kind of just roasted Jeff and his brothers, really just the guy in the windbreaker, Frankie. I kind of just made fun of him for 10 minutes and he has a dead front tooth. He dropped a fucking, he lifts every day and he dropped a fucking weight on his tooth and cracked his fucking feet as a brown front tooth. So I was like, hopefully your marriage is last forever and your love is undying much like Frankie's front tooth. That was received. Not well. Frankie's mom, my aunt was a little, she was like, what are you doing? I was like, all right, that's it for me guys. You ever 69 your fucking dad? Yeah, that would have been awesome. I would have been sick closer. Jesus Christ. No, that wasn't good. That was one where like three people came up to me afterwards. And we're like, that was fucking awesome, dude. Yeah. Like we're just the three people that watched it, watched the bomb. They were like, that was fucking hilarious. It's gotta be interesting though to see, you know, to like sit in there and you just out of nowhere to wedding. Some guy just comes up and braids your cousins. It's probably like, this is hilarious. Yeah. Some people don't like that. No, fuck. They did that to me at my sister's wedding. They made you go up and do it? Yeah. They were like, why don't you say something? So I went up and she married an Egyptian. So it was like an Egyptian mass we had right before the, so I got to make fun of that. That was easy. That was pretty fun. Cause they were like, they do that the whole fucking time. They're just like the all seeing eye everywhere. Yeah. They worship hawks and cats and shit. And like weird animal, dear man hybrids. Yeah. It was fucking nuts. But I made fun of that for a second and then people were like, you gotta stop. I was like, all right. And then I tried to, I tried, it came this, what I was going to say about my sister sounded nice in my head, but I ended up being like, she's the only one that's not a piece of shit. And my family and my other sisters just stand there like, what the fuck dude? And then I got choked up. No one, no one. He's rolling around doing family parties. You're asking. No, I didn't get choked out. I got choked up. I started crying. Oh man. But not like no one knew I was. So all like, all I said, all I said was I was like, Kate's a good son. I was like, I'm a good sister. Oh man. Like cause I was getting choked up, I couldn't really talk. Like, yeah, yeah. It's one of those things where like, if you say it, then you're going to cry. Yeah. So like in my head, I was like, all right, this will sound good. And then I started to say it. And I was like, oh, like, well, Kate's always a good sister. That's it. Yeah. I'm fucking over two on wedding speeches. Oh man. Oh, nice. I look forward to being able to do my wedding speech. Dude, just got a text from John McKeever. Oh my God. Big deal. That's a hot text. That's the hottest text you can get. If you get a text from John McKeever, you made it. John McKeever is the hottest, best comic in Philadelphia. Scorching hot. Copy that text and send it to me. I want it in my phone too. All right. I'll tell you what he said. He said, LOL. Oh man. Nice. That's a big LOL text. That's a heavy LOL. No, I mean, he said, haha. He'd probably be mad if I said he said LOL. He put LOLZ. I mean, he'd be mad that we were talking about him anyway. No. So that's funny. Yeah. Dude, he's going to hear this and hear us say he's the best comic in Philly. He's going to be like, what the fuck was that? Take that down. Dude, you fucking hate you. Yeah. That is true of Pope Wazai, man. If your parents love your comedy, quit. I don't know. Just, I don't know. That's not totally true. Yeah, definitely not quit. Don't quit. But I feel like... But it holds weight. No, it does. If they love everything you do, it's like... Yeah, I think your parents start to like you when you're in a fucking theater. Yeah. And you can bring them to the show. It's got to suck to make a kid and all of a sudden you're just like... Now you're sitting at the Midtown Arts Center in Harrisburg and he's up there like... I would come in my dad's mouth. They had such high hopes. Yeah, my mother's cried twice via Twitter one time over a clip of stand-up. But I basically... I thought it was funny for a while to tweet aggressively homoerotic stuff to the rock. And the tweet that... I gotta cut you off for a second. You are the weirdest fucking guy on the show. I am not, dude. I'm so normal. Go ahead. This is... So this guy is tweeting gay shit at the rock. Daily. And you didn't tell me when you were doing this. No, it was just me, just for myself. It was entertaining myself at work. And so the tweet that got my mom fired up was... It was like sometimes when I'm jerking off, I wonder if the rock jerks off too. And then I come so hard. That was a tweet. Come spelled C-U-M too. So it's 10 times more disgusting. And my mom found it. She just called my dad. So almost at work my dad calls me. And he's like, hey, what's this business on the internet you're doing? Like what? You're tweeting. You're sending these tweets out about it. It's disgusting. It should be on Megan's Law. Like, alright. I'm like, oh, the one about the rock? He's like, yeah, that's gross. It's disgusting. You're sick. Your mother's on it. I'm like, alright, I'll take it down. So yeah, you better do that. Your mom's on Twitter? My mom every now and again just like, well, just Google me, I think, or just like click a link. Oh, okay. No, it was, I had updated a website. So I had a live Twitter feed on my website. My mom being, you know, it was like, oh, let me see what my son's doing. Clicked on my website. It was just like, I've come so hard for the rock. And she was like, oh my God. It's just sweet woman. And I never should have subjected her to that. At first I wanted to be like, whatever, dad, no, I'm not deleting it. And then I'm like, I probably could spare the gay rock tweets from my mom. That's not asking much. So I deleted it. And I've watched myself ever since. Did the rock ever get back to you? DM me. He's like, he's like, yo, I'm at the hotel in Orlando come through. That's fucking nice. Heard you got those jacks arms when it comes to this robo arms. Yeah, I think the rocks to do. Honestly. Yeah, I don't like him very much. Yeah. I didn't even like him in the WWF. Who are you pulling for versus rock? I remember when mankind fought him. I was a big mankind. You're a mankind fan. Fuck yeah. He was lost. He always he was an underdog and he was always like doing crazy shit. Hell on a cell versus undertaker. Dude, that was mankind school. Oh, that was a hard fart and spike the mic. I'm looking at that. I'm like a ghost hunter right now looking at these wave files. That was a hard fart right there. That was a. Yeah, that's what this podcast is. It's just farts talking about Helen a cell. I was an undertaker and then you farted to the microphone and then put it back up to your face. I can't believe you did that, dude. I did not fart. I will say that fart was not mine. That is a fun game though. Whose fart was what? That was your fart. That dude, that was not my fart. I think I was talking while you farted. You're talking fart at the same time. How can I put a mic to my mouth and my ass at the same time? Though I could have another mic, one for my ass. You don't know. Hell yeah. That was a sick fart. I'm so glad you did that. This podcast is taking off. This podcast. Episode one. These people can't get enough of this. Yeah, this literally, if you're on your way to work right now, you're probably questioning everything. Like what, why did I choose what I chose? I could be in a house or on a poker table right now farting into a microphone. Yeah. Which is pretty fun. I'm not going to lie. I think my dad will listen to this. Actually, you know what's nice? My dad, there's no way he's going to know how to fucking get a hold of this. How's your mom with computers? She might hook him up. He's going to listen. He's going to want to hear himself. Yeah. It's human nature. But sometimes you just fast forward at the part you're on. He'll probably listen to the whole thing. Yeah, he'll listen to that. And then I was going to, I'll tell this story because he's going to want to hear this one. Because I don't think he knew. So every year in like, from like six through like ninth grade, my dad would take us, me and like 10 of my friends out to Notre Dame to watch their fucking spring game. It's like just a scrimmage in April and he would bring like 10 of us out in like a fucking huge van. Like what are they called? Not conversion vans. Like a 15 seater van. Yeah, like huge, like rows and rows of seats. And he would bring these kids and we were on like, this year was like the seventh grade. The seventh grade. So we all just figured out how to fucking beat off. That's sick. And that was like seventh grade. Yeah, around seventh. Shout out to me in fifth grade. Really? Yeah. Did you finish in fifth grade? I used to pee. I just stand out. Everybody grabbed their dick in fifth grade. No, no, no. I'm saying I used to, I used to masturbate, have a non climax or it was a climax cell, but I wouldn't ejaculate. I'd pee. So you squirted. I squirted. I would just stand out, do it on the toilet and stand up when I was done and pee into the bathtub every 10 hours coming. Dude, you were the weirdest fucking guy on earth. I was 10 years old. But then again, I am about to tell that story. Let me get my laptop power cord. This is a little weird. No, I'm not going to tell a story to no one. We'll just do it. No, you're a sales pitch man. No, I'm not going to do that. We'll just do it. We'll do it. We're going to take a two second. We're not even going to feel this break. You won't even feel this break. Back from the break. That was a very quick break. Yeah, you guys didn't even notice, did you? No, they didn't. But yeah, I thought I thought better. I'm not going to tell that story. It's a good idea. Just in case this podcast fucking sucks. Yeah. It's best not to spill the beans on yourself. If it does suck, then I tell a horrible story about me and my buddies. Little buddies do. Coming of age story. Yeah, it's a coming of age tale. About young boys with one old man. And an old man trapped in the eye of the boy storm. Storm of the boys hormones. The boy hurricane trapping an old man. A little bit of a teaser for you guys to stay tuned. Plus we're at 30 minutes anyway and that's plenty. You've had enough of Matt and Shane's secret podcast. Yeah. Now prepare yourself for the first ever shitcast. Enjoy this. Goodbye. Wait, what's fucking Tom? What a shitcast. Oh, the shitcast. The shitcast actually is just me trying or any guest if anyone wants to do it with me. And once again, this is the weirdest fucking dude on earth, Matt McCusker. No, this is a very much you've been up to. This is my little brain child right now. This shit for no reason. No, yeah, there was no fucking yes. So this fucking psycho has been going down to Home Depot's and bothering dudes while they shit. All right, Tom, what you're doing? So I was trying to interview people alive while they're taking a shit and see if I could get people to talk to me while they're taking a dump. Perfectly reasonable shit. And I was it wasn't no reason. I was going to use it eventually. I didn't know what for something just told me to do this. So I figured out, you know, try to get people to talk about stuff in like an anonymous setting when they're relaxed and taking a dump. And it feels more like a sexual come on. So people are very uncomfortable, but I won't stop. I will get the answers out of Americans while they relieve themselves. That's it. That's the shitcast. So that's the joy. And that was Matt and Shane's secret podcast. That was the pilot episode. So let us know what you think and. That was not me. I was jumping the scales. There's no way I could have farted. That was me. The first one was you. That definitely wasn't you. All right, that's it. All right, thank you. Hey man, I'm doing a podcast where I interview people while they take shits. Do you want to be on it? That's serious. I'm a local comedian. It's kind of want to reach out to people while they're shitting and shoot the breeze with them. It's totally anonymous. You could say whatever you want. You don't want to be on it. Shitting pretty hard there. I'll let you go. All right. You heard it first. No fucking dice. I'm feeling like slashed in front of the chapel. I'm lean back with the last ball. Shit, I smoke as like cholesterol. Spill dressing on the vest at the festival. The best of all. Had a midget Puerto Rican at my beck and call. Best believe that there was neck and fall. Fuck around and almost wrecked the sub. We took ass up to 10 days straight up in the mountains. Started running with the stallions. Playing frisbee in the West Indies. Did the tango with my kidney's eyes open. Now I know just what my kids need. Rocking very loose pants. Yeah. Rocking very loose pants. Yeah. Bevy the million in the sand by the cloud tower. Before I die take a hot shower. Ride the Harley into the sunset. Ride the Harley into the sunset. Ride the Harley into the sunset. Ride the Harley into the sunset. Ride the Harley into the sunset.",
