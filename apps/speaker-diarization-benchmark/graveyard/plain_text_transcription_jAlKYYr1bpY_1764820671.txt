The Wild Wild West. Two hours. We're doing two. Whatever you want to do. Yeah, just know the pace. We're going to talk to the page. Oh, I like that, man. I like that approach. Can you guys not release this till October? Oh, wow. I'm joking. I was going to say, I thought they're special. Yeah, totally. Also, I was waiting to share it for this episode. Thank you. I was in a tomb on Monday. Dude, trust me. When you hit me back, I was like, he just did it. He's in the tomb. He's in the tomb. I... Sorry, because discussing the tomb I was just in is... The tomb was... Sacrophagus? I was in... I've risen. I'm Lazarus right now. This is the third day. I'm actually... What's the tomb? Like, is the tomb the bed or the couch? The tomb is... I just played... There's a new game called Ready or Not. Nice. And I played it for two days. That's awesome. I played the entire... I played every mission. Meanwhile... That's so long. Psychologically, what's the thought... Is the thought process all on the mission? It's... Usually, it's 100% on the mission, which is... All right. So, that's one... It might be a bad way to deal with stress. Mm-hmm. Because I'm just focused on that. And then you go, oh, shit. I forgot about all the problems. Ugh. You know what I mean? Every time... You're not trying to work out any problems. You're going, we got to fucking clear this room, fellas. Breach. Breach. But then while you respawn, you have 15 seconds. Fuck. You get killed on some bullshit way, and then you go, yeah, fucking bullshit game. Fucking this game sucks. Fuck. Oh, shit. I forgot my life sucked, too. Fuck. Fuck. The game's awesome. I suck. Is it a war game? Yeah. It's just... You're a SWAT team. Ooh. That's awesome. You're going to love it. And the video games are back, dude. Ooh. These guys made a wild-ass game. Oh, man. I want to get that. You're breaking into, like, child porn fucking facilities. You're breaking... Yeah. Wow. Yeah, yeah. It's really a dark, fucked-up game. I'm getting that today. Yeah, well, get ready to enter the tomb. How good's it feel to clear the child porn sanctuary? Feels good. Yeah, that's nice. It feels really good. Yeah, it's awesome. Yeah. And it's like... So there's just a blast... I was about to say, you blast everyone in there. Yep. You go, what the fuck are you guys doing, dude? That's totally fair. If you're in, like, an industrial child porn place... There's school shooting out, too. What? Yeah, you clear out, like, a school shooting. Can you run away? You can hide for a while. I would run away. Fucking A. This game sounds fucking awesome. It sounds like every dude's fantasy is wrapped up into one. It is. It's like, obviously, stopping a school shooting. Obviously, wearing SWAT gear. Just that alone. Everyone wants to wear SWAT tactical gear. Although, ever since I saw the picture of Big Chungus at the protest during BLM, I realized I could never rock the SWAT gear. What? Too big to wear SWAT gear. How so? When you're a big guy in SWAT gear, it looks fucking hilarious. Have you ever seen it? Have you ever seen a big, fat guy in SWAT gear? Never thought about it. I don't know. I'll show you Big Chungus. I feel like you would look like a juggernaut. There is that. Yeah. There is that. I could wear the Hurt Locker fucking... And just be juggernaut. But juggernaut sucks. You get shot fucking nine million times. You play games, man? No, I can't have it, man. I won't stop playing it. It's like a complete time suck. You got a full family, too. Yeah. I'd imagine there's not a ton of... But wait, do you play with the kids, though? Not yet. It's getting there, though. There could be some aerial cart with a five-year-old soon. Yo. He can't be the chungus. That's insane. He can't be the big chungus. He didn't have the right gear. His gear is too small. Yeah, it's a tough one. Getting too fat for your tactical gear would be tough. Yeah. Because then it's literally life or death. You have viscera exposed. Yeah, that looks like when they brought back Boba Fett, but he was fat now. And they didn't adjust the costume. It was like up here. Some Australian dude has just been drinking for 10 years. And they're like, you want to do the role again? He's like, yeah. Yeah. I've been waiting on this call. Fuck. His helmet's like a yarmulke on his head. I don't know. Boba Fett was an Australian man? Or he might be from... Because if that's the case, he lives actually on Tatooine. I think he's New Zealand. Oh, okay. Yeah. That guy, he was in that movie When We Were Kings, which I feel like is... I don't even think I've heard of that movie. As I was saying it, I was like, I feel like Shane, this is a movie Shane would love, but I'm basing that only on the title, When We Were Kings. It's just a movie you would love. It's just a drunk guy. Fucking every night. We Were Kings. Yeah, what's the movie about? We were the fucking best. What's it about? The movie takes place at a bus stop. It takes place at a bus stop in West Philadelphia. Yeah. We Was Kings. We Was Kings. I think it's about like... I think it's kind of like Slumdog Millionaire, except in New Zealand, or one of those kind of movies. Okay. I think, or like City of God, maybe it's like that. City of God's awesome. I've never seen either movie. I heard they're both great. City of God's awesome. Yeah. It's a great title. I like subtitles, man. I'm a big subtitle movie guy. I like that. Let's talk movies. What? Let's talk movies we've never seen. Let's talk movies. City of God. City of God rules. You'd like it. Wait. I want to look up when we were... I'm going to look it up at one point. When We Were Kings is actually... What would be the best movie analysis ever? I don't know what it's about. It's like two movies I've never seen before. I think it's a guy from New Zealand. I just saw one of the shittiest movies I've ever fucking seen. What? Opus. The new John Malkovich movie. Never seen it. Where? All right. Let me just shoot the premise at you. Yeah. And you'll immediately know we're off to a bad start. John Malkovich plays a once famous R&B pop singer. What? How does he do that? Who disappears. He was big in the 80s. And then he disappears and comes back 30 years later for his opus. He's putting out another album after 30 years of absence. That always works. Yeah. And it's John Malkovich. Damn. It'd be nice if it was like late Kells. Like, yo pussy is a buffet. I love your pussy. I thought they were going to make him like a, you know, like a fucking Pink Floyd-y dude. Yeah. When I heard the premise. And I'm like, oh no, he's like a dance singer. Like a fucking like, like, like, it's so. And then they, so all these people get invited to his big compound to listen to the record. And then everybody starts dying. And it's, it's, it's Get Out. It's like the 57th time they've remade Get Out since fucking Get Out came out. What? Sucks dick. It is a terrible fucking movie. Who's the villain? Who's, who's the. He is. You're describing a pretty sick fucking movie. You'd think. You'd think. It fucking sucks. It also sounds like an event that me and my squad should probably breach and. Yes. Yeah. Tie up the civilians. Make sure everybody's taken care of. You could have stopped it. I could have stopped it. You could have stopped the onslaught. There's going to be some people. This game's a hit, dude. Yeah. There's going to be some people breaching some houses. You think so? I think so. Because it does. It gives you that. Yeah. Desire. Yeah. Your ex-wife's got a new boyfriend. That would be. You get four of your boys. You go. All right. Stack the door. Yeah. They should be doing school drop off. Fucking shock on the lock. Fraggit. 745. They haven't left yet. They should be doing drop off right now. We're going in. I think they. I don't think I'm making this up. Didn't they use Forza to actually train race drivers? Didn't they actually play fucking Forza as like a simulation before they got on the actual road? I'm not sure. Probably. Gran Turismo. Yeah. Oh, Gran Turismo. That's what it was. Yeah. That makes sense. That's insane, though, that games are getting like. I actually think what you're saying is I think like these games actually could be like tactical training before you're in the field. I mean. You know? Yeah. Nate's all. I would have failed. Fucking civilian came running around the corner. I was like, oh. He was running right at me. Everybody saw that. Scared the shit out of me. They do scare you. How do you distinguish? There's a. Oh, the worst one. There's like a for real. There's like a pulse nightclub. What? And the thing that they did in the game that always fucked me up from the actual shooting that people described it was everyone's phones going off. That was dead. Whoa. Like when the cops went in to clear it out, you could just hear every phone in the building buzzing, which is so sad. Yeah. I didn't think about that. And they kept that in the game. That's in the game. Oh, it's like a fucked up game. Yeah, man. Shit. Yeah. That used to be. They used that used to get a lot of backlash. Remember, there was a modern warfare where you had to take down the airport shooter. There was like people were like, this is fucked up. This is too far. And then other people were like, no, this is important. Well, it's definitely not important. It's fucking crazy. That mission was awesome. That mission was crazy. I don't know. I feel like it is important. If you just sit there and do that for hours and hours and hours, I do feel like if the real thing happened, you might on some level be more prepared. Well, that's exactly the problem because in this mission, you are the shooters. Oh, no. First half, you walk around with a machine gun in a fucking airport. You're an airport shooter? Yes. It's a tough one. And the mission is. Wait, I don't remember that part. The first part, you were the shooter? No, you're not. You're literally just going through killing every civilian. Oh, my God. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's really bad. All right. I forgot about that. That might be too far. It's nuts. Yeah, that's not good. That's why Call of Duty hit the old switcheroo. Zombies. It's like, I'm a purple woman sliding. Yeah. All right. I see it. They hit the peak. They're like, we made the top of the mountain. Although in Grand Theft Auto, you're essentially doing that anyway. Grand Theft Auto, there's rumors that there is a pride parade in the city. No. Fellas, don't. Don't. Don't let me catch you. Don't, dude. Those videos are going to be fucking chaos. Oh, no. Every single person that downloads the game. Straight to the parade. I do feel like, to be fair. No way. No way. And there you go. What would happen? To be fair, it's time the hookers in GTA get a break. Yeah. True. The hookers are going to be watching and be like, thank fucking God. Finally, we can relax. They're next. Once you get five stars from the fucking parade, you're headed straight to the fucking strip club. They're really doing that. You think I forgot about you? That's so funny. Yeah, they're doing that. That's, uh... I wonder if they'll make it off limits. I think they're going to reel this game back. Grand Theft Auto makes more. It'll get hacked. That game gets hacked, too. I think they're going to reel this one back. I was friends with this guy, Laszlo, that was one of the top developed guys. He was the guy that put us all into the games and shit. And he left. I forgot you were in Grand Theft Auto. Yeah, five. That's fucking awesome. It's wild. That is awesome. Faces in it. The mocap was insane. Damn. That mocap's a nightmare. It would suck. How much did you feel like it? You must have looked nuts in a mocap. By the way, it was old school mocap. It wasn't this fucking Harrison Ford shit where they put blue dots on your face. I had a helmet on with a camera in my face. It was crazy. You had to wear a frog suit, like Green Man. What was your role? What did you play? There's... When you go into the safe house or the safe house, whatever it's called, there's a TV and there's shows you can watch. And there's a show with the... Whoever the action star is in that series that's like the Stallone type. Yeah. It's a reality show about him. And I play his new agent. And I'm like this coke head. And it's me and him. We did like... We shot like 30 minutes. We shot a full episode of this thing. Whoa. And it's in the game. And then we went back and did additional content later that never got released. That I just had to sign crazy NDAs about. I'm not allowed to talk about it. Whoa, that's awesome. But anyway, it was awesome. It was fucking... He just fucks you in this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This episode is brought to you by Viore. So there's a lot of sports out there. Obviously, you've got basketball, baseball, and football. But then there's running, tennis, MMA, climbing, yoga, pickleball. And that's before you get into all the different ways you can train and work out. Right. But the good news is that you only need one pair of shorts for all of it. The core short from Viore. That's right. Wear one pair of shorts all the time. That's all you need. The workout.

The core short is the short that started it all for Viore. Mm-hmm. Fitness versatility. One short every sport. Mm-hmm. Guys, they're ideal for fitness running and training, but also stylish and comfortable. That's important. That is important. I want to be stylish. I want to be stylish and comfortable. Matt, are they soft? They're soft. They're pretty soft. A lot of Viore stuff. How much do they weigh? Yeah. Pretty lightweight. The core shorts. Is it only three-way performance or how many? I'd say it's pretty multiplex. Is it a four-way performance stretch? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely the fourth dimension. I can stretch backwards in them for sure. Also, the core is a little tougher. Some of their stuff is like borderline erotic. If you feel my shorts right here, I'm actually wearing them right now. Don't make me.

Yeah, that's awesome. They had stand-up in, was it four or five? Yeah, I think Burr, no, Gervais is doing stand-up. I think Cat Williams. Yeah, Cat Williams. I'm just going to go watch stand-up than it actually as a comedian in. That's pretty crazy. Yeah, but he's... You can bring your gun in there and you can shoot Cat Williams. Bro, stand-up special, GTA animated. That'd be awesome. A special where you're just in a mo-cap suit, you perform live in a mo-cap suit, and they recreate it in GTA V, and people can just shoot people. Really? That's what I'm saying. That's fucking sick. It literally did that. That's awesome. You can walk in. There's a comedy club. It's Ricky Gervais. That's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. It was nuts when we did it because it was like early days of that. Not early, but early days. Yeah, you should do that now again. Yeah. And just put it out as a game. Yeah, true. Just be like, this is my special. You'd shoot me. It's live. Yeah, you guys get... Nobody hears the first joke ever. They had this fucking... We were in this green room, and they had all these plastic structures, and they'd be like, that's your car, so open the door and sit in it, whatever. And you would do it, and then they'd be like, okay, come over here and look at this. It was rendering in real time. Whoa. So you'd walk over, and it didn't look like it did in the game, but it was like you getting into a fucking car in a video game immediately. It was crazy. It was fucking crazy. Yeah, that's awesome. Dude, this is like 2009. This is a while ago. That's crazy, yeah. But anyway, yeah, the game made $5 billion. I got paid three grand. And I remember calling Lazlo and going, I want a copy of Max Payne 3. And he goes, you fucking comics, man. Always looking for free shit. I go, your game just made a billion dollars. You paid me three grand. Send me fucking Max Payne 3 right now. And he's like, all right, that's fair, dude. Okay, I'll send you one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When you put it that way. But I think it's the point I'm ultimately getting at is I have a feeling with his absence, I feel like they're going to reel back in this one. I just don't think it's like Eminem saying like, look, man, time's changed. Nobody wants this anymore. I'm just not doing it anymore. I feel like they're going to pull back. Ready or not, it's kind of proven everyone wants it. Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah. That's a good point. It should be like in Mortal Kombat. Then you have to put in a setting for like, you should have settings. If you want to play kind of like, you know, reeled back GTA, you can just hit a setting. If you want to go nuts, you should just be, you get to be Hunter Biden. Yeah, there was the blood code. Hunter Biden's rocking right now. He's rocking right now. That would fire me up. He might be, dude, he might put his hat around. He's literally the O'Connor man. He is. Did you hear the way he was speaking? I've had that conversation with O'Connor 10 million times. I saw the clip. He's like, that motherfucker wants to fucking talk shit. I'm like, damn, this is the O'Connor man. I just fought him at Lala's for fucking 10 hours with this exact conversation. O'Connor, dude, is a psycho. You're a fucking idiot. O'Connor is a fucking psycho. He's a bad. I've seen him get angrier. And I'm an angry dude. O'Connor gets hot, man. O'Connor, yeah. And I know exactly how to do it. And it's so funny. Dude, you're fucking, you're Batman, dude. Remember Batman in the Justice League comics? He had a way to kill every member of the Justice League just in case it went sideways. That's Shane with every one of his friends. I know exactly how to piss you off, dude. And I'm going to do it right now. No, I'm going to be a comment. The O'Connor man's just the, I don't ever do that really to you guys. You do get the O'Connor, you get the comment. Oh, comments. It's really funny. He also, he knows too, though. He'll feel it. You'll start hitting the buttons and he'll go, I'm not doing this with you. And then, eventually. You can't, you can't. He always, he's like, Shane, I'm not doing that right now. And they go, yeah, you are. This is a classic O'Connor rule, right? When he starts getting hot, he goes like this. Dude, what the fuck are you talking about? You've reached his wall. Yeah, you've climbed his wall at that point. You're fully inside the Citadel. Dude, we were arguing. He took the Trojan horse. He fell asleep. You're cutting everybody's heads off. It's over. Shane and I were arguing about Prince. I was pro Prince. Shane was anti Prince. It was our argument. O'Connor jumped in. O'Connor got so hot. O'Connor lost his fucking mind. But, hold on. Hold on. That was, you want to talk about great, great drunks? Yeah. This was one of the all-time drunks. This was coming back from London, back to, back to the United States. And we had, like, a private room. Mm-hmm. We were flying. It wasn't private. It wasn't a private jet. But they have this thing. They're cheap as fuck. Yeah. Everybody should be doing this. There's, like, a VIP thing at big airports. Mm-hmm. For, like, $1,000. Yeah. Where they just, that you have your own security. You have your own thing. And then they just put you in a room. What? With free alcohol. And then they're like, guys, the flight got delayed by two hours. And everyone in the room was just, like, oh, shit. And we got, we drank vodka for three hours and argued about Prince for three straight hours. And Okaman was my staunchest ally. Okaman went nuts. Oh, he went nuts anti-Prince. He was like, play one fucking song. Play one fucking song. And Shane was being like, appreciate your support, Chris. You got to back it off. Like, you're going crazy right now, man. They should have reached out to air traffic control. Like, we got to get this plane up. But this is a disaster. We have a disaster on the ground. I think they let me smoke in the fucking room. Yeah, we were smoking in the room. It was. I didn't know this existed. Yeah. Either did I. I did it once. This is the second time I've done it. I did it once at JFK. And it was the biggest waste of money of all time. Really? Just a woman met me at baggage. Yeah. And walked me through and then took me to an airport lounge. And they were like. And then she left. And then they were like, you can't come in here. I was like, oh, shit. Oh, that sucks. That sucks, yeah. The closest I got to that. It was just a regular lounge. Did you ever do someone in a wheelchair at the airport? That's fucking VIP status. Yeah. My wife was super pregnant. She got the wheelchair. And you just go through, like, a weird corridor. It's awesome. Yeah. That would be a flex, dude. If you got hit the regular airport, hit the chair. I should start hitting the chair anyway. Blank it. Blank it. Blank it over my fucking head. Get it like a blackjack dealer poker player visor. Just get pushed through the airport. Float through the airport. It's the fucking move, dude. Just black out. Yeah. Just get blacked out. Start screaming about Prince from a wheelchair. Just get the Stephen Hawking set up for when you're blacked out. Just blink. Like, do you want another? Do you want some more peanuts? Just go. Yeah. Start blinking. Yes, yes, yes. Tony, you should get towed. Just get an application. I'd be like, all right, I'll have one more beer. Just walking up. Get towed by the cart. Have the guy, have the Egyptian guy scream, get out of the way. And you just get towed behind the chair. That would be nice. Yeah. Or squat up. Just have like six or four. Five or six. Get biker vests. Six or five. Hit the Mario cart. You're saying, turn the JFK into Toad's turn bike. Isn't that insane? Isn't that insane, though, that somebody could get so fat that you just get VIP? Oh, true. It's crazy. It's insane. It's crazy, dude. It's like ancient times. If someone was super fat back in the day, like, me must be a fucking ruler. Yeah, I think if people found like just vague records of our civilization, they'd be like, they worshipped fat people. Yeah. They did everything for the fats. Dude, when I was reading about the Aztecs, there was one of the guys that Cortez linked up with who was like a rival against Montezuma. He was a fat king and he had servants literally hold his belly up for him. So he would come talking like, yo, we got to fuck up Montezuma. And then he had two guys the whole time just holding his belly while he talked. That's what used to be like doing YKWD. He'd get in there, there'd be five dudes just, yes, Bobby, yes. Like, dude, you're a fucking punk. It's crazy. Yes, Bobby, get him. Shut the fuck up, dude. Yeah, fuck you, dude. Don't fucking talk to me like that, dude. I listen to the regs. You ever listen to the regs? Yeah, it's funny. The regs is great. It's great. It's funny. The regs clips come up for me. It is so funny. It's the best. Wait, wait. Speaking of dudes, it'll throw down the drama. Soty's another one. Soty will get fired up. Soty will get amped. They were playing college football. No, I've told this story a thousand times. I think Danny might hate it. I'm sorry. No, it's okay. Dan, I love you, dude. It's funny, though. He spas. I've never seen a hard ever. Obviously, I've seen you hit some hard spas. I'm a bad video game spas. You hit more. Girl. It's girl spas. I run away. I'm running up the steps. Yeah. I'm like, fuck this. This game sucks. I hate you. You guys are wasting all your time anyway, dude. Fuck this. Running up the steps. To an air mattress. You guys are the fucking losers. Going up stairs. I don't see why you waste your time. I literally played all day by myself. Like, I'm going to be chained in a video game. Got my ass handed to me. It was like, you guys are fucking losers. Wasting time with this shit and ran up the stairs. I get so mad. I get so mad. Just dick down on an air mattress. I fucking hate these guys. I get so... Oh, dude. I play by myself and scream at the TV. Dude. I was playing Last of Us, and I couldn't figure out how to get through this place. I was trying to get a ladder down to climb out of this room, and it wouldn't let me take the ladder down. There's nothing worse. And then you walk over to it, and it's like, press A. You're like, how the fuck did I miss that? It wasn't letting me. And the zombies kept attacking me, and I was dying instantly. And I was literally alone in my house in Pennsylvania, and I was going, well, it's fucking stupid if one fucking bite kills you. What's the fucking point? Dude, my neighbors must have been like, what the fuck is going on in there? I lose my shit, dude. I used to bite the fucking cable on the NES controller. Oh, no. That's nuts. Yeah, when I was a kid, I would get so mad. I'd go, I'd go, I've never heard the cable bite. The cable bite's intense. I would lose my shit. My friend used to cable whip his little brother with the PS2. That's a move. He would pull out the PS2 controller and go, whoosh, and start. Cable whip's just scary. Cable whip is crazy. Did you ever see what he did you? Oh, sorry. I'll still get, like when we, those Oklahoma kids were playing me in UFC, if it's a big game, the heart rate goes up. Oh, dude. Like that time you and me were playing, that might have been the most stressful video game of all time. That was. Just playing UFC in front of, I don't know. Honks. Honks. It was like Zac Efron. Zac Efron, Robert Pattinson, and Christian McCaffrey. It was literally a dream threesome. It's hilarious. It's fucking hilarious. For real. And Matt pulled the ups. I choked under pressure. He's beaten me like four times ever. That was one of them. Yeah. Wow. I just choked. You didn't go to the ground. You could have went to the ground. That was honorable. I had to get, I mean, it was too good of a fight, dude. It was such a good battle. Every kick that landed, people in the room were like, oh. Oh, he didn't get me. He didn't get me. Oh, dude, that's fucking good. Did you ever have, did you ever have somebody, like, I've had friends, like, literally punch me. Probably, if I had ever, probably there's been fights. Well, we were younger, but it's like, like when we were 16 in Street Fighter 2 on Super Nintendo was huge, whatever. Yeah, I remember I was, I would play with my friend Kevin, and if you beat him, he would literally punch you. That's so funny. And he would go, I could beat the fucking shit out of you in real life. Big Jay's one, that's a scary one. Really? He doesn't get violent, but that, like, it changes the day. If you beat him in a game, it changes. Like he gets a pouty? The rest of the day. A little. Like sad? Yeah, he'll get you there. He'll start getting you. He'll go, what the fuck are you being mean to me for? Oh, yeah, I forgot I beat you in Xbox last week. I'm also, I'm a sore, I'm a sore winner too. I'm better with it now. When I was younger, I was, I was always bad at video games. You are a sore winner. So when I win, I would do a thing where I would like just sit there, I grab what I, I have a drink next to me and just go, and just do shit like that. And like, dude, for real, stop doing that. I'm like, this is just water, I'm thirsty. I'm just drinking. Maybe you're, maybe you're upset. And then start being like, yeah, you know, it's just what I do. I kind of go low and you kind of go high to me and it's just, shut the fuck up, dude. The, I, I never, I think the only time I've ever beaten you in a video game was when we played Mortal Kombat. Every other game we've ever played each other against, you've beaten me. You guys are out doing activities. MK is the Achilles heel for sure. I'm working on it. You've got better than MK. No. I'm working on it. No. Bring it, dude. It's coming. Bring it. I'm fucking swinging swords with Conan right now. It's coming. Oh yeah, you downloaded the fucking game and started playing it. Yeah, fuck. You actually said to me, this is, that's bullshit. This was an insane thing to say to me. No, that's bullshit. I downloaded the game and you go, no, I downloaded the game and you go, don't get good at it because I'm not going to play it. And I'm like, oh, I can't have fun because you're not going to play it. no, no. It was crazy. Hold on. This is game stealing. This is almost worse than French stealing. Coming over, going, oh, the new Mortal Kombat's good because we were playing it together and having a nice time because we were just as good. Yeah. Go home and download it and practice. No, I want to play it. That's game stealing. That's coward shit. That game sucks. The game sucks by yourself. No, it doesn't, dude. You have not played with Conan, man. It's fucking righteous, dude. It's righteous. That game. When you win a match, he goes like this and they recreate the poster from Conan the Barbarian. It's fucking awesome. How many times do you get to see that? I've never been told. Seven dozen. You never get sold. No, it never gets sold, dude. It never gets sold and the guy doing his voice is good. T-1000's awesome. Yeah. Quest mode sucks in Mortal Kombat. Yeah. One player blows. One player sucks. Yeah. One player, I've tried it. It fucking sucks but training, just being in the dojo, training and just being like, yeah, let's pop it on. What are you guys playing? 17 hit combo. You're like, what the hell the fuck did I do that? Combos are nuts. The trailer for the new movie looks all right. Yeah, I like the more. Really? I disagree. I like that at the end when Scorpion flew in and they did the get over here. I didn't make it to the end. Oh, really? I turned it off with like 30 seconds or like 20 seconds. I don't think he's a good Johnny Cage. I think it's miscast. He's playing. I think so too. Carl Urban from, what's he on? The Boys? The Boys, the Boys, yeah. He doesn't look like Johnny Cage. Like Johnny Cage was kind of modeled after Jean-Claude Van Damme. Yeah. And like, Johnny Cage, he should be prettier. Like he's not, Carl Urban's not pretty enough. The whole cool thing about Johnny Cage is that he's like a pretty boy. He's a pretty boy. But he's a badass. Punches you in the dick. Yeah. It literally should be like Ryan Felipe. You know what I mean? Yeah. Wait, not Ryan Felipe. Ryan Gosling. I've never heard him called Ryan Felipe. No, Ryan Felipe's a dude. No, I know, but I always thought it was Felipe. No, I think it's Felipe. I thought it was Felipe too. Really? They should have, they should have Kevin Spacey as Johnny Cage. Hold on a second. By the way, shout out to Felipe. We were just chilling with him. He's a listener to the podcast. Felipe's gonna hear that. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. I'm a big fan of Felipe. The way, the way of the gun. Yeah. Yeah. He's the fucking cool. are we? Oh, you know what? Actually, Ryan, if you are listening, I know that, I know that you were friends with Sean Price and Sean Price is to me one of the greatest rappers that ever lived. Friend steal. What else you got? There it is. Shout out to Sean Price. Sean Price. Shout out to Ryan Felipe. Yeah. But yeah, Sean Price rips. Hold on. How am I first? You guys never heard of his? It's Felipe. I've always heard Felipe. Yeah, that's how I always pronounce it. This is nuts. My actor database is horrible. It's like embarrassing. People are like, well, I'm like, I've never, no. It's gotta be. It's Will Smith, Robert Williams. I'm like A plus actors. It has to be, you gotta be A plus. How do you pronounce it? Guys, produce the show. She's crying. There's four dudes. This guy's just staring at us. Look at LeMaire. He's cashing a check right now. He's doing mobile. Oh my God. LeMaire, you can't see it at home. LeMaire's feet aren't touching the ground. He's on a stool. Fully just. You guys got me fully charged to talk about Mortal Kombat. Nice. We can get some MK going. I hate Mortal Kombat now. Why? Why? It used to be, it sucks. The lore's bad. I knew it was Philippe. It is? Yes. Wait, who said, no, you can't go by the way the Google voice thing. They probably actually. Oh, really? Everybody's always, it's Ryan Philippe. Whoa, I've been calling him Felipe forever. Holy shit. Felipe is crazy. Philippe. I think it's got a beautiful ring to it. Felipe. I knew I wasn't wrong, dude. I knew me and Ryan were boys. Dang. Damn. Damn. You tried to friend steal and mispronounce his name? he's probably furious right now. That's crazy. Dude, I'm going to play fucking Mortal Kombat with Ryan. I'm going to let my bros ride on you, dude. You know what I'm going to? I'm going to let my, my, my, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild.

Fucking disaster. I left a, I mean, I literally painted my bowl this morning. Yeah. It was crazy. There's nothing wrong with that. No, it was a little paint job. Uh, do you ever pack extra underwear when you travel? How much extra do you ever need it? Pretty much an extra pair per day. I always bring extra underwear. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I'm fucking shitting my pants constantly. Yeah. I just used to really work. Fuck you guys getting at here. Do you wipe standing or sitting down? Does it make a difference? What is going on? Dude? How horny are these people? What did they want to know? There's gotta be something about standing up though. Like I, I'm a standup wiper, honestly sitting down. I just smears. I don't know. I can't do it. Uh, well, Matt, whichever way you wipe, it's time to show your B holes, some respect and upgrade to dude wipes. Dude wipes tackle the mess without any fuss. And the flushable design makes cleanup a breeze. They leave no room for dingleberries or stray butt crumbs that TP might miss. Plus they're extra large and designed for adults.

I have actually, I've had a huge development. So, you know, I suffer from body acne. You know, I suffer in silence. My stomach breaks out, especially with the sweat and the heat down here. I'm sorry. Yeah. Thank you, man. It's fucking dude. I found, you know, I went to a dermatologist and like, dude, those guys, I, I, I don't, they don't do anything. Everything. I'm like, whenever I eat this, why don't you shower? True. All right. Thanks. No, they're like, well, there's no, you know, like whatever you eat, whatever. I'm like, no, dude, if I dairy, my whole stomach breaks out. They're like, there's no real science behind that. I'm like, dude, it literally has lived it. It's a lit. It happens to me. Yeah. It happens every time. Dude, recently I, it's been for real, like groundbreaking. Cause whenever you go to the ocean, you know, your skin clears up. Yeah. So I was like, how could I recreate that? I got a bucket of dead sea salt and I just go in the shower. Now I wet myself and I just cover myself in salt head to toe and just let it sit. Let it sit on me for like five minutes. Completely cleared my skin up. Yeah. My wife hates it. I'm going to have to grub you, dude. Grub me up. You better stop. I'm like, wag you. I'm like, you're grubbing yourself. Dude, it cleared it up. It's the only thing that's ever worked. And it's salt. It's fun. You get a big bucket of it for 30 bucks. Yeah. Sun and salt water are the two. I had, I don't know why I forget what happened, but I had like an act, like a full on acne outbreak a year ago. Really? And, uh, or a year and a half ago. And it was in the winter and I think it was, yeah, it was gross. It sucks. It sucks. Being our age and getting acne. It's the worst. What the fuck is happening? But it was because I was, I was still living in New York and it was like, it was raining every day and it was dark. And like, I just, it was, it was definitely related to weather. And I went and I did the Joker's cruise and it cleared up on the cruise. Yeah. Like it just cleared up immediately as soon as I got in the sun and there was like a saltwater pool. Bro, I had, I had a insane, like a rare skin disease when I was younger. That sucks. I get, yeah, just out of nowhere. I've told you that's peter Isis. Out of nowhere. I've never seen anything like it. It was just patches of red all over me and didn't itch. Didn't burn. It was nothing. Does it look like a red spot? Like sunburn? The first one does. There's a Harold patch that comes first. I was just looking at the mirror and I just had a big red mark here. Okay. And I was like, all right, whatever. I don't give a fuck. And then started multiplying. It was just all over me. Oh. But it was only where sun doesn't get you. So it's from your knees to your elbows. Like it was just where you wear clothes. Yeah. And then my family and I went to the beach. Clear it up. Clear it up. Did it ever. But I had to lay in public with a giant red skin rash. Yeah. Did it ever get like rashy and raised or was it always just like your skin? It was a little rashy and raised, but it still didn't itch or. Yeah. Yeah. I got you. Skin's fucking weird. Cause it is an organ. It's an organ on your body. You're right about dermatologists though. Like a dermatologist is a little bit like, yep, that's pretty gross. You know, here's some cream, you know, like in the cream, the reason you can't do it for more than two weeks is because a lot of it's, it will, it thins your skin. Yeah. And you buy what I've had with the creams. Use a lot. I have, I get a thing called sensitive. I get a thing called. Also, I've had it washed down to my balls and you know, and it like my ball skin is would go crazy from whatever they were giving me. Ball skin goes the craziest. Oh, ball skin. When it goes, the absolute, when that stuff goes down, you get dried out ball sack, bro, that's three years. It's the exact, that's not going away for three fucking years. It's the worst. Yeah. It sucks. I actually dealt with an armpit rash for an entire year last year. What were you using? A new deodorant with alcohol? it was the same old deodorants. I just, uh, it was almost like I got jock itch. Yes. I've gotten that before. And it just lingered. I think there's nothing worse than an armpit rash. Cause you have to put deodorant on it and it burns and it itches so bad. And you, you, I was plowing through it. I was just putting fucking, uh, antifungal cream on it. Filming tires. It was while we were filming. It went from the summer into when we were filming time. It was a nightmare. I don't wear it. I don't wear deodorant. I'll put it on like once every now and again. Do you not sweat though? I do. And I'll smell a little bit, but it's like, dude, my armpits get dry from deodorant. It's like, I fucking hate. I remember brute. Yeah. Dude, that stuff was flammable. I used to run it across the carpet and light it on fire and it would just go, make like a line. Jesus Christ. Sick. It was the carpet. I fucked up a beach rental when I was a little kid one time. Cause I would make designs in the carpet and like, you would light for two seconds. Just like little fight. Well, I didn't do the, I didn't do the, yeah. I didn't do the swat. You didn't do the coolest design possible to set on fire. I would do a little like loop de loop tracks. The one time it did get out of control. And I was like, fuck, fuck, fuck. How did your parents not know you were lighting the carpet on fire? I don't know. I would just do it. It was a beach trip. They were probably fucking shit face. But at one time I, yeah, they were. It was a beach trip. It was 11 a.m. They were blacked out at the beach. Yeah. Yeah. My parents never drank growing up. So they, they knew everything I was doing. I wish I had parents that fucking just got rocked. Sorry, I was a joke about it, but it is, it is the best. Yeah. I mean, you have a parent come home drunk. You go, Oh, for sure. This is a fun day. Yeah. Yeah. I missed out. Drunk dad is awesome. Your dad gets drunk when you're little. Although the first time I did get scared because I read a book in the library saying like, it was all about like, drunk and hitting your mom. So it was like, the book was called like, why does dad hit mom when he drinks? It was something like that. First time I saw my dad drunk, I was just like, he's beating the fuck out of my mom right now. And I was just a little coward. I just sat in my room. Like, I hope he doesn't go too hard on her. Yeah. He didn't at all. He was so friendly. He sat on the steps and cried. Yeah. I should go in there. He was just literally like, he would come in and be like, dad. I'd be like, well, dad, don't look at beat mom. Oh, that's great. Drunk dad. That's super friendly. Phil is still that. He gets, he comes home. He goes, fuck yeah. Then you see him in the morning. He's like, how are you? You're a fucking punk. Oh, you're hungover. You're being, I'm not hungover. He's never been hungover once. Hitting a girl with hungover is very funny. I've done it before. I'd be like, you're just hungover and being fucking great. I'm not even hungover at all. It's like, yeah, you're a little edgy. Everybody loves denying a hangover. Hey, it's crazy. Everybody's favorite thing to do is go. I'm not, you know, what's crazy. I feel pretty good. There you go. I'll tell you guys right now, I'm fucking hungover as shit. Really? Oh yeah. You put it on. That's why you asked how long this podcast was. No, no. I was just, I was literally just curious. Stop riding me, dude. That's too much lotion. That's thin skin. We were, we were in London in the van and you were fucking with me. I was like, back off, dude. You just kept going, I'm on your bumper, boy. I'm on your fucking bumper. You're trapped. You got three days in the UK. You're not going anywhere. You were on his ass in the UK. I was. It's so funny. Till we got off the flight. Till we landed back there. I mean, we were screaming in the fucking airport. Holy shit, dude. We got prime. I mean, you guys might have talked about it already, but we got prime O'Connor video over there. Yeah. We got some classics. Him at the height of his powers. Yeah. I saw him running through the streets of London. I'm from London. Like throwing shit. Yeah. He was a, he's a real problem. That's what I like about him though. He turns up that hard and then you won't see him for two weeks. He's got, he's got to mend himself. He goes home and he lays there. He enters the tent. Oh, I saw him last night. I got to read. I got to fucking cook. I got to become a good person. And then you go, why don't you come out? Yeah. Yeah. There's bounce backs are crazy. It's pretty impressive. I saw him last night. We were in the green room. We had two drinks and I was like, what are you doing, dude? He's like, I don't know. I might go see Sadie, whatever. And he fucking snuck out. I was like, he's dodging it. Yeah. He's trying to be good. You got to respect the dog. Yeah. I get it. I get it, man. I get it. I'm fucking terrible at it. I let everybody talk me into fucking hanging out. I am the worst. Yeah, but you do it. You do it just as much. You're one of the worst perpetrators of it. Yeah. Yeah. Come on, dude, take a shot. My birthday's next week. Yeah. I'm taking a thousand shots with you. And every time you go, you never take shots. It's, it's been literally years. Literally. We've, we've taken shots together. We took shots together last week at Mitzi's. I did not take any shots with you at Mitzi's. Yeah, we did. We did. Yeah. At the corner. Yeah. Shit. Well, you got me there. And you said it. I remember it. You go, you'd never take shots. My boy. We took shots for the last week. My dude. It's every week. It's so funny. It is usually late. Yeah. If I'm taking a shot. I was talking to Carrie at mothership last night about, she's like, what are you doing tomorrow, baby? I was like, I'm doing Matt and Shane. And, uh, I was just taught, telling her about when you just start pressuring to drink. And I was like, I'm going to be sitting on that couch. He's going to be like, come on, come on, let's get one. Come on. Let's go. I was like, she's like, wow. And I was like, I can't say no to the man. No, we got to, no, I can't today. I can't today. Stop, dude. No, stop, dude. No, I got spots tonight. No, I can't. Yeah. All right. I can't, I've got to remain in the tomb, dude. I put together a run. I got to. True. But I was just, I was like, Friday. True. I'll make it to Friday. I don't fly out till Saturday. Where are you headed? Uh, back up to PA. Cause I got to do some pods in New York and then Rhode Island gigs and, and then some other stuff.

Thank you. I appreciate it. And at first I didn't like the blurry shots and then I came around. All right. Thank you. I was a little on the fence about them too at first, but then the closer we got to, cause I was, I directed it too. So I was very involved from start to finish with everything. And, um, I was a little on the fence about it too, but then ultimately I was like, Oh no, it works. It's, it's, I don't know. It's, it was, you know, it was a nice device I thought or whatever, but, but yeah, man, I appreciate you. I missed the actual taping. I was at the after party. you showed up right as the party was starting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was bummed. I missed that. It was, it was a good, it was, I was thrilled. You, you came down, you rolled in with six, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's, I was thrilled you came down. Definitely got bullied into taking a shot. Well, it's always a special. Yeah. Yeah. It's always a special. Um, but, uh, yeah, it's called, I never promised you a rose garden. It's on my YouTube at Joe, at Joe, the Rosa. So youtube.com slash at Joe, the Rosa comedy. Uh, but anyway, I hope people enjoy it. Yeah, it's good. But, uh, I was, that's the hardest. It's a really good special. Thank you, dude. It means a lot to me to hear you say that because, and Matt, feel free to jump in with the compliment. I, I, I haven't seen it yet. So I always feel bad. I don't see it. And I usually, and I usually, uh, fuck, fuck, fuck. Don't watch. I watched yours a lot. I haven't finished it yet, but I've watched a lot of it. I'm not blowing smoke up your ass. I did the same thing with you. Like, I was like, you're one of, no, no, no, no. I'm saying though, like, I don't, I hear you. It's like, it's, it's kind of hard sometimes when you do comedy and you're around it all the time to jump into a special. But you're one of the guys where it's like, I'm like, I was like excited. And we've done enough shows where I know the material. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was, it was stoked. Ask Ardini. He told me his special. I'm like, that's going to be awesome. I can't wait to see that. Thanks guys. They were actually singing your praises before you got in. Thanks guys. I really appreciate it. How much they liked the, I heard the way it started out and I was like, awesome. The starting, the starting bit of material. I was like, that's, let's not, let's not get any spoilers, but I can't wait for the start of your special. Yeah. Can't wait. No spoilers. No spoilers. But yeah, I heard, I was here and I was like, that's thanks brother. Perfect. Thanks dude. It's the, it's, it's literally the hardest I ever worked on anything in my whole life. That's like those three years of, uh, of touring and I was going to shoot it at one point. And Ari Shafir was like, it's not ready. It's not ready yet. It's not ready. You know? And then like when I finally did do it, like him being like, it's like I did it to, I was like, all right. That's awesome. Good for him for, cause that's hard to tell someone. But boy, if somebody told me it's not ready when I thought it was ready. We argued. I mean, me and Ari did argue. I wasn't just like, okay. Yeah. I was like, it's ready, dude. I don't need to do it for three years. And he goes, he goes, oh yeah, cause you're the one. And I was like, God damn. All right. But, but yeah, like you, but I don't know. It's like, it's nice having friends. Like again, I'm not blowing smoke, but it's nice having friends who also do comedy that when they put something out, like when you put out your last one, you're excited to watch it. Cause it's like, yeah, it's easy to get. I have a friend who sucked. Yes. Like check out this special. Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited for yours, dude. Thank you, man. Yeah.

I don't know. I don't know what the fuck the joke is. I kept saying last night, I was like, he should have dressed me up, man. He should have dressed me up. I could have done that. I was like, I could have done that. I know the joke easily could have been NHL. I know. No, no. Or NASCAR. Or golf. you mean fucking. Let me put that shit on, dude. Well, then we wouldn't be talking right now, but we would be considered the greatest of all time. We wouldn't still be talking. I just showed up fully prepared for the role. What the fuck are you doing? We can save it. Oh, I thought she was like, what the joke's about? Oh shit. I got to take this off. Fuck. It's not coming off. It was, it was fun for me to watch it again. I'm sitting next to Jalen Carter. Fuck. I'm just like a black lady. Dude, I saw the rewatching it and seeing the people behind us, like clapping in earnest. And then it's revealed and they go, that was very, very fun to see. The, uh, fucking asshole.

Yeah. That's enough to, so like after the ESPYs, I had to go do Kansas city and Oklahoma city. Yeah. And those, you know, you're doing a show like that. That's, that's a lot of fucking stress. I don't know how you also, I flew home on Friday and I for real thought I was going to fall down. Friday sucked ass. Oh fuck. Yeah. I had a later flight. Yeah. But like not that much later. I texted these guys like we're already there. I was walking through the airport. Like I felt like I was like not getting enough oxygen. That's how it feels. Because you were just so hung over to me. I didn't have like the headache or anything, but I was just, I had like three hours, two hours of liquor fast. Yes. I had like two hours of sleep and just walking through the airport with like my bag. Just like I for real might go down. I was like lightheaded. Bro. It's so bad. So that day I woke up in the hotel going, yes, I have nothing to do today. Perfect. And then I was like, oh shit, I got to fly to Oklahoma and do a show. Then the next morning I woke up like finally I can fucking go home. Fuck. I got to go to Kansas fucking city. God damn it. Yeah. I don't know what's going on. I guess this is what being burnt out is, but yeah. Anxious like dreams. Yeah. And then I wake up going, I don't have anything to do. Nice. Fuck. Dude, you just did a thing that six people have done. It was the movie. Yeah. The movie filming a movie for a month and a half was, yeah, I've never done anything like that. Yeah. And then shows. And then the, yeah, you're running through a very unique. It's time to, it's time to lay down. Yeah. Yeah. And oh yeah. And we filmed commercials that I'm seeing the edits to those. I don't fucking love them. I go, oh great. Yeah. There's nothing worse than watching yourself in a way where you're like, I don't like that. While you're anxious and hung over and you see a video of yourself, you go, it sucks. It was fun. I was trying to upload all of this stuff from our drunk podcast that next day in the airport. I'll just watch it and be like, Oh, the anxiety of that podcast. Thank you. With the second half, the second half's in the tomb forever. NFT. Until, until one day. Yeah. We're going to sell it to Martin Screlly for $6 million. $6 million. Yeah. Yeah. No, that, that airport hangover. Oh, like, like, honestly, I like almost have a panic attack. Yeah. I carry Xanax for it. Cause, cause you're, it's so like, your gut is related to your anxiety and all that shit. And when you're in that state, you're walking, you're like, you might have to take a shit. You don't know. Yeah. And then that's shit at any moment. Yeah. It's hard. You could. No, I mean, physically, I could walk into a bathroom and take a shit while hung over at any, if someone said take a shit right now, I go, no problem. Oh, you mean like on command? Yes. Oh, that's great. One's chambered at all times. Yeah. All right. Yes, sir. That'll help me. Yes, Danny. Yes, Danny. Yeah. That's just so good. I'm like, I'm like a hundred. You can't handle a clear gay joke. I'm 103 degrees. My face is, I have like 103 degree fever. And then I just woke up and I did the opposite. I pounded coffee to like power through. So nothing like heart palpitation. It was terrible. Yeah. Heart palpitation. It was terrible. It's fucking nuts. Then, you know, the B-dubs at the airport's just right there going. It is. Yeah. You're nothing without me, coward. When I did, when I did, I did, I did kill Tony when they did the HEB center down here. I did the panel and I was only supposed to do a set. And then I showed up and he was like, I need you to panel buddy. And I was like, all right. And I was so hung over. And I started the same thing, dude, dehydrated. I felt like sick. I felt like I had a cold. I started fucking pounding coffee to wake up. And then I was meeting it with booze to get like tuned up. Dude, I got on stage. My gut started turning. My hand to God, dude, I had a two minute panic attack on stage. I was sitting there. I was so, I was hitting me from all angles. And I was sitting there. The first bucket pull came out. The kid was talking to us. And my brain was like, it's a lot of fucking people out there, dude. It was all lit up. If you watch the video, you see me do this. You see, this is the desk. And I just go like this. I just put the mic down. I just stare. I'm going to freak out right now. I was like, I was literally looking like, where can I run off this fucking stage? That's tough. And then it just, it just stopped. And I was like, oh, that's hangover. That's like bad anxiety. I get that doing standup. Where like, I'll like forget the next thing I'm going to talk about. And it's like a 30 second thing in my head where it's like, this is it, dude. You're going to have to look at all these people and go, I can't do this. I'm sorry, guys. I don't know why I just walk off and you just power through and you're like, all right, thank God. no, I've been there, dude. Maria Bamford said she used to like, she said she would like take comfort in knowing that at any second she, she had the option of running out of the club and never returned. She was like, that's the only way I can get through it. Like sometimes. Yeah. It's like, fuck. It is nice. When you get on stage and you go, oh yeah, I can do standup. Yeah. After the first like minute you go, oh fuck you. Yeah. Nice. Cause for the last hour and a half, I've been back there going, fuck. I can't do this. Oh fuck. Yeah. Yeah. I've done the coffee, pre-show coffee to where I'm on stage and my heart's like, and I'm like, all right, I'm going to fucking, this, this might be it. And then I've done it where I'm like, maybe I have a heart attack. And I really leaned into it and powered through. And I was like, I was so proud of myself. I was so proud of myself. I had horrible pain in my chest. I was headlining. It was like two years ago. It might've been two or three years ago. You might've had a heart attack. Bro. It hurt. It hurt so bad that I, I was like, I have to get off stage. Yeah. And then I was like, well, this is my last joke. Just fucking. And I just did my last joke, got off stage. I was like, I'm pretty sure I just had a heart attack up there. Yeah. And you never got a check or anything? Nah. People have little ones. That's something. I don't, I don't think it was an actual heart attack. I think. People go in the doctor like, dude, you've had like three heart attacks. You're like, what? I was 34. Dude, I know someone who got one at like 24 years old. I mean, they were, they were taking heavy subs and then other recreationals, but. Yeah. I was on zero recreationals. Yeah. If you can have them without knowing, I've definitely had them. If that's an option, there's no way I haven't had heart attacks. There's no way. Well, if I ever had one, that was it. Yeah. I mean, that sounds like hard. I've never had something that hurt. Like my fucking wall. I'll be like, ah, it's like, oh, I'll tell you. I'll tell you. Fuck. I'll tell you a perfect formula for, I'm going to have a heart attack on stage. This has happened to me several times. You'll be at mothership. You'll be in the green room. You look up and realize the guy on stage in the main room only has 30 seconds left. And you go, oh fuck. And you run all the way. Dude, you get on stage. I've done that. I can't catch my breath on stage. Dude, I'll do this on the stool. I'll lean like this. And I swear to God the whole time, I'm like, I think I'm going to have a heart attack right now. That is a fucking labyrinth back there. Yeah. You got to go up and down five flights of steps. I felt bad last night because we're all backstage. And I, people are backstage. Like you were backstage and you had, you probably had like four minutes. I'll say something. It was eight. I was like, I always go bro. But I feel like a dick because I'm like, Hey, DeRosa, you're up next, right? He's like, yeah, I'm going down. I'm like, I feel like an asshole. Like I'm like, dude, you better get down there. No, I do it. I do it. I do it on shows. I'm not even on. I get nervous. I'll be like, yo, I think I was fucking. Yeah, dude, I get nervous on other people's behalf. You never know when someone's going to fucking just go. That's it. I know. It was GD and he have GD and he dug his heel. Obviously, luckily he's a big stage hug. Doug his heels in. Yeah. Yeah. You actually probably were like, Oh, GD is always going to get along. I was nervous when it's like eight minutes in, I see the clock and I'm going like, dude, it's a while to get down there. Did you ever go on stage there and you realize you forget the dude you're bringing on his last name for sure? Yeah. And you're like, I forgot the headliners. Joe Rogan. Fucking Joe. This podcast is an experience. It's got an experience. It's the. Dude. The other McDonald clip fucked me up. Did you ever see her go down? Yeah. I think about that. Yeah. I watch it. I go. Cause I, you know, I've obviously laughed about it publicly. So it's like, I'm like, that's going to happen to me now. It's going to happen. Dude. There's, there's a, there's a trilogy. There's a perfect trilogy. Uh, Heather McDonald. Yeah. Wendy Williams. uh, Gallagher. Oh, and you're forgetting the goat, Pablo Francisco. He went down. Did he collapse on stage? No, but he says that that's a wild meltdown. Yeah. Yeah. That's a wild. That's the, that's the number one for me. He broke. Well, well, we've had, you've heard me say it a million times. You don't think I can get out of this? Oh, okay. So, Oh no, you're in good. You're in safe hands. Get down. Get to the chopper. You don't think I can get out of this folks? There's some of the videos that cuts and then it cuts them being, that's the one that made me. Yeah. Yeah. Just straight to the airport. Stretch a gun. You don't think I can get out of this? Oh no. Oh no. He got locked in a bit. He got locked in the bit. Dude, he's in like a K hole with a bit. No. Yeah. Like, he can't get out of this bit. And he's gone. I can, I can, I can, but like, wait, hold on. Oh, this is, this is fun. He's at the hospital. Like, it's not funny. Let it go. It's like, no, it's funny. I can get to the end of the bit. Just let me finish the fucking bit. Let's keep interrupting. Top three. So that's, that's stage meltdowns. That's a different category though. That's, but that's right. That's the number one of meltdowns. Two, two might go to Swartzen. Did you just say Swartzen? Swartzen was awesome. He's just like, so, all right. He's so high. He can't even like make sentences. And the lady just comes out and pulls him off stage. Dude, that's, dude, that's in the background of my head the entire time. Oh, you're about to, here it comes, dude. You're about to start rambling incoherently. Oh my God. I thought the O'Conn man was going to have one. He, when we did the Chicago theater, he went out with Santino during the day. Oh, Jesus Christ. I went out, I met him. I had like one beer and I was like, we got Chicago theater tonight. Yeah. Yeah. I left. They show up. They didn't, they didn't leave. He never went back to the hotel. They went from the bars straight to the show. O'Conn man walks in the green room. Like, so I was like, Holy shit, dude, you're blacked out. And I was like, fine, dude, get the fuck out there. Go out there. Yeah. He killed. That's awesome. God damn. That's pretty impressive. That's awesome. Oh, dude, he's from a fucking another dimension, man. He is. O'Connor should be in the next mortal combat. He really does. He might be the drunken master. That's insane. Wait, third, but wait, they got a number three best meltdown. The Lampanelli one is wild. Do you remember that one? it happened. Where people are walking out and then people are helping her. People are going like, she's yelling at somebody and then people are being like, it's okay, lace. And she's like, shut the fuck up. I don't need any fucking help from you. And she's like turning on people supporting her and shit. Like, it's a, I'm not throwing any shade. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This could happen to any of us. Yeah. We're just, it's just funny. Like I've, I've, I have, I've been banned from clubs. I've freaked on stage. Yeah. You're a psycho. Yeah. Yeah. You're a wild dog. Yeah. I got banned from the laugh factory in New York. Did you really? Yeah. Cause I told the audience, I said, I hope you all get fucking AIDS and die in a car accident on your way home tonight. You're a bunch of fucking animals. I got banned. It's probably during like a decent set. I was just at the end. They were, it was so rowdy, dude. It was crazy how rowdy it was. Yeah. And then I went back to the club, like, and I was like, I don't understand why you won't book me anymore. And the booker was like, because you told the audience, I hope you get AIDS and die in a fucking car. Do you, do you think that's okay? I was like, well, they weren't, they were shit. I don't know. What was I supposed to do? Yeah. I've freaked. Have you guys ever freaked? I've, I've lost my shit. I've spazzed. I've never spazzed. The only one that's Fort Wayne was, I was just like, all right, that's good. It's the end of the show. I haven't done it in 15 years. Like I learned. I did it now. Bakersfield. That was a tough one. Spazz. They were, they were wild. I spazzed on one guy in Phoenix, Arizona. I like kind of just started traveling headlining and the weekend wasn't going well. Ticket sales weren't great. And then there was like in this, the, one of the rooms is a copper blues. There was a, they have like multiple ones. I think there's one of those rooms. Where there's like, you know, like seating, but then they have booths to like the right of the stage. Yeah. So it was just a guy in a fucking like leather jacket talking. So fucking loud. the, what was it called? It's not the, it's around there. It's. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. They have multiple, but this guy was talking and it was just like, you know, I was like, whatever, like shut up. But then at one point, Brittany went up to him. She was there. It was like, he'd be quiet. And he said something to her. And I like, just stopped mid joke. It was like, shut the fuck up pussy. And like spaz. It was like a fight. Fuck yeah. It was bad. And I was like, anyway, I was just fucking around guys. Yeah. Pure, pure red face spaz had him. Cause like eventually I think I had him come up on stage and he just called me gay without a microphone. I'm like, it just backfired on me. And I was like, look up and get up here. And he's like, you're just a fucking gay pussy. And I'm like, damn, nice jacket, bitch. Get off the stage. This isn't working. It's just go straight. Gay guy. Well, your jacket is discussing. Fuck you. He told me at an Uber driver, you have an Uber driver jacket, dude, get the fuck out of here. But it was just, they're always right around. He was getting louder though. He was winning the debate. I'm like, get the fuck out of here. He's like, you're fucking gay. That was, that was, it wasn't really a spaz, but in that Tempe improv, uh, that was where that gremlin from high school got me. Oh, you remember that? This kid from high school showed up and he was like, after the first show, he's sitting in the green room. He's like, I would give that like a C, C minus. Oh, and then he spent an hour in between shows talking about how I sucked at football in his class. And then stayed. It was crazy. I mean, I don't know how you didn't choke him. Other people were looking like, yeah, what the, what the fuck's going on? I don't know how you didn't choke him. And then he, uh, stayed for the second show and I killed. And every time I had a good joke, I just looked directly at him. Just gone. Yeah. Yeah. C minus. You little fucker. Every single joke for an hour. I was just, every time I'm going, what do you think of that? What do you think of that? You fucking cock. He was like that. Nothing to him. He was like, that was good. Oh, that was, now that was good. I love how people like that. Flip it. Now that was good. See, go fuck yourself. I'm like your coach. Yeah. That's weird. a spaz is always right around the corner. I've, I've without question in recent year, when I, I, I'm speaking way too, uh, uh, liberally when I say I learned my lesson, because I, I'll still yell at an audience, but I figured out somehow to sometimes make it kind of funny to like beat them in to get, but like, I, I could easily see having a full, having a full freak at any, you know, it's, it's, it's, it won't take much, dude. It doesn't take much. It's a couple of annoying people. Let's start getting to your shows, you know? Yeah. What's that? Let's start hanging around the back of your shows. I mean, I just want to, I fucking sucks. The ultimate, I just want to be clear that I stand with Pablo, Lisa. Oh, for sure. For sure. Yeah. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not making fun of it. It's funny to see though. I'm con, I'm convinced it will happen. I'm like, it's, I'm going to join the pantheon of dudes who freak out one day and just completely break and be like, I don't know why I do this. I'm sorry guys. Please refund everything. I'm fighting it the entire time. I do anything. The, but wait, you never saw Gallagher having the heart attack on stage. Yeah. It's during the fucking watermelon. No. He walks over, picks. It's just so fucked up to laugh at him. It's fucking hilarious. Yeah. No, he goes over to the water. He picks up the hammer and he goes, Oh, fuck. No. He goes down. Oh, he goes down. He goes down. He has a fucking heart attack. He has a real one. Yeah, dude. Oh, that's what I was saying. There was two categories. There's collapse on stage versus meltdown. I mean, a prop. Yeah. Cause Heather McDonald's was pretty fucking elite. Hers was crazy. Cause she was like, I got all the vaccine. What? Oh, sorry. Good prop guy going down. Oh, it's crazy. With a hammer, a mallet in your hand over his head. Like the watermelon finally won. The watermelon was like, he's literally doing a thing that would give any human a heart attack. He's doing it on stage. It's closer. Yeah, dude. Exactly. Time was finally like, that's enough, dude. Yeah. But wait, did Heather McDonald ever explain what happened to her? I haven't seen the explanation. No. I'm sure she talked about it somewhere, but I never, I've never saw it addressed at all. She just fainted. Yeah. But it was like, she just happened to be talking about how boosted she was. That was the worst part. I just jinxed it. Yeah. True. Wait, what was she talking about? She was talking, she was bragging about how many. Her last lines were like how many boosters and how many times she's gotten the vaccine. Then her last line's like, so yeah, Jesus loves me. Yeah. And the worst part was the crowd thought it was a bit and they were like, yeah, it's timed perfectly. Yeah. It was fucked up. Yeah. That's a great bit. That's true. But yeah, I think she really got hurt. She fucking, I think she hit her head. Dude, she got fucked up. Yeah. She had a skull fracture. Yeah. God. Yeah. She got fucked up and it was just like these idiots who didn't get the vaccine. Ha ha. I've gotten all of them. Ha ha. God loves me. I've never even gotten. Ha ha. And fucking. Literally got killed. God was just like, yeah, yeah, enough of that. Holy shit. Jesus Christ. Yeah. The Wendy Williams one happened on TV. Yeah. I saw that. Yeah. By the way, she was sick. Wendy Williams rules. She does. I didn't know Wendy Williams ruled. I don't know. I don't know much about her. Watch clips. She's fucking hilarious. Yeah. She is funny. She's doing, she's doing a show at comics in New York. Were you around when comics was there? Oh my God. I'm going to pee my fucking pants. Yeah. I'm going to pee my pants too. We take a break. I can't move, dude. We'll see you later. Are we in an hour? Yeah. Oh, dude, let's slide to the page. Yeah. I've been fighting it for like 10 minutes. I could have been page right there. We'll see. Yeah, true. It was a lot of standup talk. Okay. We'll see. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.
