The Wild Wild West. Two hours. We're doing two. Whatever you want to do. Yeah, just know the pace. We're going to talk to the page. Oh, I like that, man. I like that approach. Can you guys not release this till October? Oh, wow. I'm joking. I was going to say, I thought they're special. Yeah, totally. Also, I was waiting to share it for this episode. Thank you. I was in a tomb on Monday. Dude, trust me. When you hit me back, I was like, he just did it. He's in the tomb. He's in the tomb. I... Sorry, because discussing the tomb I was just in is... The tomb was... Sacrophagus? I was in... I've risen. I'm Lazarus right now. This is the third day. I'm actually... What's the tomb? Like, is the tomb the bed or the couch? The tomb is... I just played... There's a new game called Ready or Not. Nice. And I played it for two days. That's awesome. I played the entire... I played every mission. Meanwhile... That's so long. Psychologically, what's the thought... Is the thought process all on the mission? It's... Usually, it's 100% on the mission, which is... All right. So, that's one... It might be a bad way to deal with stress. Mm-hmm. Because I'm just focused on that. And then you go, oh, shit. I forgot about all the problems. Ugh. You know what I mean? Every time... You're not trying to work out any problems. You're going, we got to fucking clear this room, fellas. Breach. Breach. But then while you respawn, you have 15 seconds. Fuck. You get killed on some bullshit way, and then you go, yeah, fucking bullshit game. Fucking this game sucks. Fuck. Oh, shit. I forgot my life sucked, too. Fuck. Fuck. The game's awesome. I suck. Is it a war game? Yeah. It's just... You're a SWAT team. Ooh. That's awesome. You're going to love it. And the video games are back, dude. Ooh. These guys made a wild-ass game. Oh, man. I want to get that. You're breaking into, like, child porn fucking facilities. You're breaking... Yeah. Wow. Yeah, yeah. It's really a dark, fucked-up game. I'm getting that today. Yeah, well, get ready to enter the tomb. How good's it feel to clear the child porn sanctuary? Feels good. Yeah, that's nice. It feels really good. Yeah, it's awesome. Yeah. And it's like... So there's just a blast... I was about to say, you blast everyone in there. Yep. You go, what the fuck are you guys doing, dude? That's totally fair. If you're in, like, an industrial child porn place... There's school shooting out, too. What? Yeah, you clear out, like, a school shooting. Can you run away? You can hide for a while. I would run away. Fucking A. This game sounds fucking awesome. It sounds like every dude's fantasy is wrapped up into one. It is. It's like, obviously, stopping a school shooting. Obviously, wearing SWAT gear. Just that alone. Everyone wants to wear SWAT tactical gear. Although, ever since I saw the picture of Big Chungus at the protest during BLM, I realized I could never rock the SWAT gear. What? Too big to wear SWAT gear. How so? When you're a big guy in SWAT gear, it looks fucking hilarious. Have you ever seen it? Have you ever seen a big, fat guy in SWAT gear? Never thought about it. I don't know. I'll show you Big Chungus. I feel like you would look like a juggernaut. There is that. Yeah. There is that. I could wear the Hurt Locker fucking... And just be juggernaut. But juggernaut sucks. You get shot fucking nine million times. You play games, man? No, I can't have it, man. I won't stop playing it. It's like a complete time suck. You got a full family, too. Yeah. I'd imagine there's not a ton of... But wait, do you play with the kids, though? Not yet. It's getting there, though. There could be some aerial cart with a five-year-old soon. Yo. He can't be the chungus. That's insane. He can't be the big chungus. He didn't have the right gear. His gear is too small. Yeah, it's a tough one. Getting too fat for your tactical gear would be tough. Yeah. Because then it's literally life or death. You have viscera exposed. Yeah, that looks like when they brought back Boba Fett, but he was fat now. And they didn't adjust the costume. It was like up here. Some Australian dude has just been drinking for 10 years. And they're like, you want to do the role again? He's like, yeah. Yeah. I've been waiting on this call. Fuck. His helmet's like a yarmulke on his head. I don't know. Boba Fett was an Australian man? Or he might be from... Because if that's the case, he lives actually on Tatooine. I think he's New Zealand. Oh, okay. Yeah. That guy, he was in that movie When We Were Kings, which I feel like is... I don't even think I've heard of that movie. As I was saying it, I was like, I feel like Shane, this is a movie Shane would love, but I'm basing that only on the title, When We Were Kings. It's just a movie you would love. It's just a drunk guy. Fucking every night. We Were Kings. Yeah, what's the movie about? We were the fucking best. What's it about? The movie takes place at a bus stop. It takes place at a bus stop in West Philadelphia. Yeah. We Was Kings. We Was Kings. I think it's about like... I think it's kind of like Slumdog Millionaire, except in New Zealand, or one of those kind of movies. Okay. I think, or like City of God, maybe it's like that. City of God's awesome. I've never seen either movie. I heard they're both great. City of God's awesome. Yeah. It's a great title. I like subtitles, man. I'm a big subtitle movie guy. I like that. Let's talk movies. What? Let's talk movies we've never seen. Let's talk movies. City of God. City of God rules. You'd like it. Wait. I want to look up when we were... I'm going to look it up at one point. When We Were Kings is actually... What would be the best movie analysis ever? I don't know what it's about. It's like two movies I've never seen before. I think it's a guy from New Zealand. I just saw one of the shittiest movies I've ever fucking seen. What? Opus. The new John Malkovich movie. Never seen it. Where? All right. Let me just shoot the premise at you. Yeah. And you'll immediately know we're off to a bad start. John Malkovich plays a once famous R&B pop singer. What? How does he do that? Who disappears. He was big in the 80s. And then he disappears and comes back 30 years later for his opus. He's putting out another album after 30 years of absence. That always works. Yeah. And it's John Malkovich. Damn. It'd be nice if it was like late Kells. Like, yo pussy is a buffet. I love your pussy. I thought they were going to make him like a, you know, like a fucking Pink Floyd-y dude. Yeah. When I heard the premise. And I'm like, oh no, he's like a dance singer. Like a fucking like, like, like, it's so. And then they, so all these people get invited to his big compound to listen to the record. And then everybody starts dying. And it's, it's, it's Get Out. It's like the 57th time they've remade Get Out since fucking Get Out came out. What? Sucks dick. It is a terrible fucking movie. Who's the villain? Who's, who's the. He is. You're describing a pretty sick fucking movie. You'd think. You'd think. It fucking sucks. It also sounds like an event that me and my squad should probably breach and. Yes. Yeah. Tie up the civilians. Make sure everybody's taken care of. You could have stopped it. I could have stopped it. You could have stopped the onslaught. There's going to be some people. This game's a hit, dude. Yeah. There's going to be some people breaching some houses. You think so? I think so. Because it does. It gives you that. Yeah. Desire. Yeah. Your ex-wife's got a new boyfriend. That would be. You get four of your boys. You go. All right. Stack the door. Yeah. They should be doing school drop off. Fucking shock on the lock. Fraggit. 745. They haven't left yet. They should be doing drop off right now. We're going in. I think they. I don't think I'm making this up. Didn't they use Forza to actually train race drivers? Didn't they actually play fucking Forza as like a simulation before they got on the actual road? I'm not sure. Probably. Gran Turismo. Yeah. Oh, Gran Turismo. That's what it was. Yeah. That makes sense. That's insane, though, that games are getting like. I actually think what you're saying is I think like these games actually could be like tactical training before you're in the field. I mean. You know? Yeah. Nate's all. I would have failed. Fucking civilian came running around the corner. I was like, oh. He was running right at me. Everybody saw that. Scared the shit out of me. They do scare you. How do you distinguish? There's a. Oh, the worst one. There's like a for real. There's like a pulse nightclub. What? And the thing that they did in the game that always fucked me up from the actual shooting that people described it was everyone's phones going off. That was dead. Whoa. Like when the cops went in to clear it out, you could just hear every phone in the building buzzing, which is so sad. Yeah. I didn't think about that. And they kept that in the game. That's in the game. Oh, it's like a fucked up game. Yeah, man. Shit. Yeah. That used to be. They used that used to get a lot of backlash. Remember, there was a modern warfare where you had to take down the airport shooter. There was like people were like, this is fucked up. This is too far. And then other people were like, no, this is important. Well, it's definitely not important. It's fucking crazy. That mission was awesome. That mission was crazy. I don't know. I feel like it is important. If you just sit there and do that for hours and hours and hours, I do feel like if the real thing happened, you might on some level be more prepared. Well, that's exactly the problem because in this mission, you are the shooters. Oh, no. First half, you walk around with a machine gun in a fucking airport. You're an airport shooter? Yes. It's a tough one. And the mission is. Wait, I don't remember that part. The first part, you were the shooter? No, you're not. You're literally just going through killing every civilian. Oh, my God. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's really bad. All right. I forgot about that. That might be too far. It's nuts. Yeah, that's not good. That's why Call of Duty hit the old switcheroo. Zombies. It's like, I'm a purple woman sliding. Yeah. All right. I see it. They hit the peak. They're like, we made the top of the mountain. Although in Grand Theft Auto, you're essentially doing that anyway. Grand Theft Auto, there's rumors that there is a pride parade in the city. No. Fellas, don't. Don't. Don't let me catch you. Don't, dude. Those videos are going to be fucking chaos. Oh, no. Every single person that downloads the game. Straight to the parade. I do feel like, to be fair. No way. No way. And there you go. What would happen? To be fair, it's time the hookers in GTA get a break. Yeah. True. The hookers are going to be watching and be like, thank fucking God. Finally, we can relax. They're next. Once you get five stars from the fucking parade, you're headed straight to the fucking strip club. They're really doing that. You think I forgot about you? That's so funny. Yeah, they're doing that. That's, uh... I wonder if they'll make it off limits. I think they're going to reel this game back. Grand Theft Auto makes more. It'll get hacked. That game gets hacked, too. I think they're going to reel this one back. I was friends with this guy, Laszlo, that was one of the top developed guys. He was the guy that put us all into the games and shit. And he left. I forgot you were in Grand Theft Auto. Yeah, five. That's fucking awesome. It's wild. That is awesome. Faces in it. The mocap was insane. Damn. That mocap's a nightmare. It would suck. How much did you feel like it? You must have looked nuts in a mocap. By the way, it was old school mocap. It wasn't this fucking Harrison Ford shit where they put blue dots on your face. I had a helmet on with a camera in my face. It was crazy. You had to wear a frog suit, like Green Man. What was your role? What did you play? There's... When you go into the safe house or the safe house, whatever it's called, there's a TV and there's shows you can watch. And there's a show with the... Whoever the action star is in that series that's like the Stallone type. Yeah. It's a reality show about him. And I play his new agent. And I'm like this coke head. And it's me and him. We did like... We shot like 30 minutes. We shot a full episode of this thing. Whoa. And it's in the game. And then we went back and did additional content later that never got released. That I just had to sign crazy NDAs about. I'm not allowed to talk about it. Whoa, that's awesome. But anyway, it was awesome. It was fucking... He just fucks you in this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This episode is brought to you by Viore. So there's a lot of sports out there. Obviously, you've got basketball, baseball, and football. But then there's running, tennis, MMA, climbing, yoga, pickleball. And that's before you get into all the different ways you can train and work out. Right. But the good news is that you only need one pair of shorts for all of it. The core short from Viore. That's right. Wear one pair of shorts all the time. That's all you need. The workout.

The core short is the short that started it all for Viore. Mm-hmm. Fitness versatility. One short every sport. Mm-hmm. Guys, they're ideal for fitness running and training, but also stylish and comfortable. That's important. That is important. I want to be stylish. I want to be stylish and comfortable. Matt, are they soft? They're soft. They're pretty soft. A lot of Viore stuff. How much do they weigh? Yeah. Pretty lightweight. The core shorts. Is it only three-way performance or how many? I'd say it's pretty multiplex. Is it a four-way performance stretch? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely the fourth dimension. I can stretch backwards in them for sure. Also, the core is a little tougher. Some of their stuff is like borderline erotic. If you feel my shorts right here, I'm actually wearing them right now. Don't make me.

Yeah, that's awesome. They had stand-up in, was it four or five? Yeah, I think Burr, no, Gervais is doing stand-up. I think Cat Williams. Yeah, Cat Williams. I'm just going to go watch stand-up than it actually as a comedian in. That's pretty crazy. Yeah, but he's... You can bring your gun in there and you can shoot Cat Williams. Bro, stand-up special, GTA animated. That'd be awesome. A special where you're just in a mo-cap suit, you perform live in a mo-cap suit, and they recreate it in GTA V, and people can just shoot people. Really? That's what I'm saying. That's fucking sick. It literally did that. That's awesome. You can walk in. There's a comedy club. It's Ricky Gervais. That's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. It was nuts when we did it because it was like early days of that. Not early, but early days. Yeah, you should do that now again. Yeah. And just put it out as a game. Yeah, true. Just be like, this is my special. You'd shoot me. It's live. Yeah, you guys get... Nobody hears the first joke ever. They had this fucking... We were in this green room, and they had all these plastic structures, and they'd be like, that's your car, so open the door and sit in it, whatever. And you would do it, and then they'd be like, okay, come over here and look at this. It was rendering in real time. Whoa. So you'd walk over, and it didn't look like it did in the game, but it was like you getting into a fucking car in a video game immediately. It was crazy. It was fucking crazy. Yeah, that's awesome. Dude, this is like 2009. This is a while ago. That's crazy, yeah. But anyway, yeah, the game made $5 billion. I got paid three grand. And I remember calling Lazlo and going, I want a copy of Max Payne 3. And he goes, you fucking comics, man. Always looking for free shit. I go, your game just made a billion dollars. You paid me three grand. Send me fucking Max Payne 3 right now. And he's like, all right, that's fair, dude. Okay, I'll send you one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When you put it that way. But I think it's the point I'm ultimately getting at is I have a feeling with his absence, I feel like they're going to reel back in this one. I just don't think it's like Eminem saying like, look, man, time's changed. Nobody wants this anymore. I'm just not doing it anymore. I feel like they're going to pull back. Ready or not, it's kind of proven everyone wants it. Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah. That's a good point. It should be like in Mortal Kombat. Then you have to put in a setting for like, you should have settings. If you want to play kind of like, you know, reeled back GTA, you can just hit a setting. If you want to go nuts, you should just be, you get to be Hunter Biden. Yeah, there was the blood code. Hunter Biden's rocking right now. He's rocking right now. That would fire me up. He might be, dude, he might put his hat around. He's literally the O'Connor man. He is. Did you hear the way he was speaking? I've had that conversation with O'Connor 10 million times. I saw the clip. He's like, that motherfucker wants to fucking talk shit. I'm like, damn, this is the O'Connor man. I just fought him at Lala's for fucking 10 hours with this exact conversation. O'Connor, dude, is a psycho. You're a fucking idiot. O'Connor is a fucking psycho. He's a bad. I've seen him get angrier. And I'm an angry dude. O'Connor gets hot, man. O'Connor, yeah. And I know exactly how to do it. And it's so funny. Dude, you're fucking, you're Batman, dude. Remember Batman in the Justice League comics? He had a way to kill every member of the Justice League just in case it went sideways. That's Shane with every one of his friends. I know exactly how to piss you off, dude. And I'm going to do it right now. No, I'm going to be a comment. The O'Connor man's just the, I don't ever do that really to you guys. You do get the O'Connor, you get the comment. Oh, comments. It's really funny. He also, he knows too, though. He'll feel it. You'll start hitting the buttons and he'll go, I'm not doing this with you. And then, eventually. You can't, you can't. He always, he's like, Shane, I'm not doing that right now. And they go, yeah, you are. This is a classic O'Connor rule, right? When he starts getting hot, he goes like this. Dude, what the fuck are you talking about? You've reached his wall. Yeah, you've climbed his wall at that point. You're fully inside the Citadel. Dude, we were arguing. He took the Trojan horse. He fell asleep. You're cutting everybody's heads off. It's over. Shane and I were arguing about Prince. I was pro Prince. Shane was anti Prince. It was our argument. O'Connor jumped in. O'Connor got so hot. O'Connor lost his fucking mind. But, hold on. Hold on. That was, you want to talk about great, great drunks? Yeah. This was one of the all-time drunks. This was coming back from London, back to, back to the United States. And we had, like, a private room. Mm-hmm. We were flying. It wasn't private. It wasn't a private jet. But they have this thing. They're cheap as fuck. Yeah. Everybody should be doing this. There's, like, a VIP thing at big airports. Mm-hmm. For, like, $1,000. Yeah. Where they just, that you have your own security. You have your own thing. And then they just put you in a room. What? With free alcohol. And then they're like, guys, the flight got delayed by two hours. And everyone in the room was just, like, oh, shit. And we got, we drank vodka for three hours and argued about Prince for three straight hours. And Okaman was my staunchest ally. Okaman went nuts. Oh, he went nuts anti-Prince. He was like, play one fucking song. Play one fucking song. And Shane was being like, appreciate your support, Chris. You got to back it off. Like, you're going crazy right now, man. They should have reached out to air traffic control. Like, we got to get this plane up. But this is a disaster. We have a disaster on the ground. I think they let me smoke in the fucking room. Yeah, we were smoking in the room. It was. I didn't know this existed. Yeah. Either did I. I did it once. This is the second time I've done it. I did it once at JFK. And it was the biggest waste of money of all time. Really? Just a woman met me at baggage. Yeah. And walked me through and then took me to an airport lounge. And they were like. And then she left. And then they were like, you can't come in here. I was like, oh, shit. Oh, that sucks. That sucks, yeah. The closest I got to that. It was just a regular lounge. Did you ever do someone in a wheelchair at the airport? That's fucking VIP status. Yeah. My wife was super pregnant. She got the wheelchair. And you just go through, like, a weird corridor. It's awesome. Yeah. That would be a flex, dude. If you got hit the regular airport, hit the chair. I should start hitting the chair anyway. Blank it. Blank it. Blank it over my fucking head. Get it like a blackjack dealer poker player visor. Just get pushed through the airport. Float through the airport. It's the fucking move, dude. Just black out. Yeah. Just get blacked out. Start screaming about Prince from a wheelchair. Just get the Stephen Hawking set up for when you're blacked out. Just blink. Like, do you want another? Do you want some more peanuts? Just go. Yeah. Start blinking. Yes, yes, yes. Tony, you should get towed. Just get an application. I'd be like, all right, I'll have one more beer. Just walking up. Get towed by the cart. Have the guy, have the Egyptian guy scream, get out of the way. And you just get towed behind the chair. That would be nice. Yeah. Or squat up. Just have like six or four. Five or six. Get biker vests. Six or five. Hit the Mario cart. You're saying, turn the JFK into Toad's turn bike. Isn't that insane? Isn't that insane, though, that somebody could get so fat that you just get VIP? Oh, true. It's crazy. It's insane. It's crazy, dude. It's like ancient times. If someone was super fat back in the day, like, me must be a fucking ruler. Yeah, I think if people found like just vague records of our civilization, they'd be like, they worshipped fat people. Yeah. They did everything for the fats. Dude, when I was reading about the Aztecs, there was one of the guys that Cortez linked up with who was like a rival against Montezuma. He was a fat king and he had servants literally hold his belly up for him. So he would come talking like, yo, we got to fuck up Montezuma. And then he had two guys the whole time just holding his belly while he talked. That's what used to be like doing YKWD. He'd get in there, there'd be five dudes just, yes, Bobby, yes. Like, dude, you're a fucking punk. It's crazy. Yes, Bobby, get him. Shut the fuck up, dude. Yeah, fuck you, dude. Don't fucking talk to me like that, dude. I listen to the regs. You ever listen to the regs? Yeah, it's funny. The regs is great. It's great. It's funny. The regs clips come up for me. It is so funny. It's the best. Wait, wait. Speaking of dudes, it'll throw down the drama. Soty's another one. Soty will get fired up. Soty will get amped. They were playing college football. No, I've told this story a thousand times. I think Danny might hate it. I'm sorry. No, it's okay. Dan, I love you, dude. It's funny, though. He spas. I've never seen a hard ever. Obviously, I've seen you hit some hard spas. I'm a bad video game spas. You hit more. Girl. It's girl spas. I run away. I'm running up the steps. Yeah. I'm like, fuck this. This game sucks. I hate you. You guys are wasting all your time anyway, dude. Fuck this. Running up the steps. To an air mattress. You guys are the fucking losers. Going up stairs. I don't see why you waste your time. I literally played all day by myself. Like, I'm going to be chained in a video game. Got my ass handed to me. It was like, you guys are fucking losers. Wasting time with this shit and ran up the stairs. I get so mad. I get so mad. Just dick down on an air mattress. I fucking hate these guys. I get so... Oh, dude. I play by myself and scream at the TV. Dude. I was playing Last of Us, and I couldn't figure out how to get through this place. I was trying to get a ladder down to climb out of this room, and it wouldn't let me take the ladder down. There's nothing worse. And then you walk over to it, and it's like, press A. You're like, how the fuck did I miss that? It wasn't letting me. And the zombies kept attacking me, and I was dying instantly. And I was literally alone in my house in Pennsylvania, and I was going, well, it's fucking stupid if one fucking bite kills you. What's the fucking point? Dude, my neighbors must have been like, what the fuck is going on in there? I lose my shit, dude. I used to bite the fucking cable on the NES controller. Oh, no. That's nuts. Yeah, when I was a kid, I would get so mad. I'd go, I'd go, I've never heard the cable bite. The cable bite's intense. I would lose my shit. My friend used to cable whip his little brother with the PS2. That's a move. He would pull out the PS2 controller and go, whoosh, and start. Cable whip's just scary. Cable whip is crazy. Did you ever see what he did you? Oh, sorry. I'll still get, like when we, those Oklahoma kids were playing me in UFC, if it's a big game, the heart rate goes up. Oh, dude. Like that time you and me were playing, that might have been the most stressful video game of all time. That was. Just playing UFC in front of, I don't know. Honks. Honks. It was like Zac Efron. Zac Efron, Robert Pattinson, and Christian McCaffrey. It was literally a dream threesome. It's hilarious. It's fucking hilarious. For real. And Matt pulled the ups. I choked under pressure. He's beaten me like four times ever. That was one of them. Yeah. Wow. I just choked. You didn't go to the ground. You could have went to the ground. That was honorable. I had to get, I mean, it was too good of a fight, dude. It was such a good battle. Every kick that landed, people in the room were like, oh. Oh, he didn't get me. He didn't get me. Oh, dude, that's fucking good. Did you ever have, did you ever have somebody, like, I've had friends, like, literally punch me. Probably, if I had ever, probably there's been fights. Well, we were younger, but it's like, like when we were 16 in Street Fighter 2 on Super Nintendo was huge, whatever. Yeah, I remember I was, I would play with my friend Kevin, and if you beat him, he would literally punch you. That's so funny. And he would go, I could beat the fucking shit out of you in real life. Big Jay's one, that's a scary one. Really? He doesn't get violent, but that, like, it changes the day. If you beat him in a game, it changes. Like he gets a pouty? The rest of the day. A little. Like sad? Yeah, he'll get you there. He'll start getting you. He'll go, what the fuck are you being mean to me for? Oh, yeah, I forgot I beat you in Xbox last week. I'm also, I'm a sore, I'm a sore winner too. I'm better with it now. When I was younger, I was, I was always bad at video games. You are a sore winner. So when I win, I would do a thing where I would like just sit there, I grab what I, I have a drink next to me and just go, and just do shit like that. And like, dude, for real, stop doing that. I'm like, this is just water, I'm thirsty. I'm just drinking. Maybe you're, maybe you're upset. And then start being like, yeah, you know, it's just what I do. I kind of go low and you kind of go high to me and it's just, shut the fuck up, dude. The, I, I never, I think the only time I've ever beaten you in a video game was when we played Mortal Kombat. Every other game we've ever played each other against, you've beaten me. You guys are out doing activities. MK is the Achilles heel for sure. I'm working on it. You've got better than MK. No. I'm working on it. No. Bring it, dude. It's coming. Bring it. I'm fucking swinging swords with Conan right now. It's coming. Oh yeah, you downloaded the fucking game and started playing it. Yeah, fuck. You actually said to me, this is, that's bullshit. This was an insane thing to say to me. No, that's bullshit. I downloaded the game and you go, no, I downloaded the game and you go, don't get good at it because I'm not going to play it. And I'm like, oh, I can't have fun because you're not going to play it. no, no. It was crazy. Hold on. This is game stealing. This is almost worse than French stealing. Coming over, going, oh, the new Mortal Kombat's good because we were playing it together and having a nice time because we were just as good. Yeah. Go home and download it and practice. No, I want to play it. That's game stealing. That's coward shit. That game sucks. The game sucks by yourself. No, it doesn't, dude. You have not played with Conan, man. It's fucking righteous, dude. It's righteous. That game. When you win a match, he goes like this and they recreate the poster from Conan the Barbarian. It's fucking awesome. How many times do you get to see that? I've never been told. Seven dozen. You never get sold. No, it never gets sold, dude. It never gets sold and the guy doing his voice is good. T-1000's awesome. Yeah. Quest mode sucks in Mortal Kombat. Yeah. One player blows. One player sucks. Yeah. One player, I've tried it. It fucking sucks but training, just being in the dojo, training and just being like, yeah, let's pop it on. What are you guys playing? 17 hit combo. You're like, what the hell the fuck did I do that? Combos are nuts. The trailer for the new movie looks all right. Yeah, I like the more. Really? I disagree. I like that at the end when Scorpion flew in and they did the get over here. I didn't make it to the end. Oh, really? I turned it off with like 30 seconds or like 20 seconds. I don't think he's a good Johnny Cage. I think it's miscast. He's playing. I think so too. Carl Urban from, what's he on? The Boys? The Boys, the Boys, yeah. He doesn't look like Johnny Cage. Like Johnny Cage was kind of modeled after Jean-Claude Van Damme. Yeah. And like, Johnny Cage, he should be prettier. Like he's not, Carl Urban's not pretty enough. The whole cool thing about Johnny Cage is that he's like a pretty boy. He's a pretty boy. But he's a badass. Punches you in the dick. Yeah. It literally should be like Ryan Felipe. You know what I mean? Yeah. Wait, not Ryan Felipe. Ryan Gosling. I've never heard him called Ryan Felipe. No, Ryan Felipe's a dude. No, I know, but I always thought it was Felipe. No, I think it's Felipe. I thought it was Felipe too. Really? They should have, they should have Kevin Spacey as Johnny Cage. Hold on a second. By the way, shout out to Felipe. We were just chilling with him. He's a listener to the podcast. Felipe's gonna hear that. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. I'm a big fan of Felipe. The way, the way of the gun. Yeah. Yeah. He's the fucking cool. are we? Oh, you know what? Actually, Ryan, if you are listening, I know that, I know that you were friends with Sean Price and Sean Price is to me one of the greatest rappers that ever lived. Friend steal. What else you got? There it is. Shout out to Sean Price. Sean Price. Shout out to Ryan Felipe. Yeah. But yeah, Sean Price rips. Hold on. How am I first? You guys never heard of his? It's Felipe. I've always heard Felipe. Yeah, that's how I always pronounce it. This is nuts. My actor database is horrible. It's like embarrassing. People are like, well, I'm like, I've never, no. It's gotta be. It's Will Smith, Robert Williams. I'm like A plus actors. It has to be, you gotta be A plus. How do you pronounce it? Guys, produce the show. She's crying. There's four dudes. This guy's just staring at us. Look at LeMaire. He's cashing a check right now. He's doing mobile. Oh my God. LeMaire, you can't see it at home. LeMaire's feet aren't touching the ground. He's on a stool. Fully just. You guys got me fully charged to talk about Mortal Kombat. Nice. We can get some MK going. I hate Mortal Kombat now. Why? Why? It used to be, it sucks. The lore's bad. I knew it was Philippe. It is? Yes. Wait, who said, no, you can't go by the way the Google voice thing. They probably actually. Oh, really? Everybody's always, it's Ryan Philippe. Whoa, I've been calling him Felipe forever. Holy shit. Felipe is crazy. Philippe. I think it's got a beautiful ring to it. Felipe. I knew I wasn't wrong, dude. I knew me and Ryan were boys. Dang. Damn. Damn. You tried to friend steal and mispronounce his name? he's probably furious right now. That's crazy. Dude, I'm going to play fucking Mortal Kombat with Ryan. I'm going to let my bros ride on you, dude. You know what I'm going to? I'm going to let my, my, my, wild, wild, wild, wild, wild.

Fucking disaster. I left a, I mean, I literally painted my bowl this morning. Yeah. It was crazy. There's nothing wrong with that. No, it was a little paint job. Uh, do you ever pack extra underwear when you travel? How much extra do you ever need it? Pretty much an extra pair per day. I always bring extra underwear. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I'm fucking shitting my pants constantly. Yeah. I just used to really work. Fuck you guys getting at here. Do you wipe standing or sitting down? Does it make a difference? What is going on? Dude? How horny are these people? What did they want to know? There's gotta be something about standing up though. Like I, I'm a standup wiper, honestly sitting down. I just smears. I don't know. I can't do it. Uh, well, Matt, whichever way you wipe, it's time to show your B holes, some respect and upgrade to dude wipes. Dude wipes tackle the mess without any fuss. And the flushable design makes cleanup a breeze. They leave no room for dingleberries or stray butt crumbs that TP might miss. Plus they're extra large and designed for adults.

I have actually, I've had a huge development. So, you know, I suffer from body acne. You know, I suffer in silence. My stomach breaks out, especially with the sweat and the heat down here. I'm sorry. Yeah. Thank you, man. It's fucking dude. I found, you know, I went to a dermatologist and like, dude, those guys, I, I, I don't, they don't do anything. Everything. I'm like, whenever I eat this, why don't you shower? True. All right. Thanks. No, they're like, well, there's no, you know, like whatever you eat, whatever. I'm like, no, dude, if I dairy, my whole stomach breaks out. They're like, there's no real science behind that. I'm like, dude, it literally has lived it. It's a lit. It happens to me. Yeah. It happens every time. Dude, recently I, it's been for real, like groundbreaking. Cause whenever you go to the ocean, you know, your skin clears up. Yeah. So I was like, how could I recreate that? I got a bucket of dead sea salt and I just go in the shower. Now I wet myself and I just cover myself in salt head to toe and just let it sit. Let it sit on me for like five minutes. Completely cleared my skin up. Yeah. My wife hates it. I'm going to have to grub you, dude. Grub me up. You better stop. I'm like, wag you. I'm like, you're grubbing yourself. Dude, it cleared it up. It's the only thing that's ever worked. And it's salt. It's fun. You get a big bucket of it for 30 bucks. Yeah. Sun and salt water are the two. I had, I don't know why I forget what happened, but I had like an act, like a full on acne outbreak a year ago. Really? And, uh, or a year and a half ago. And it was in the winter and I think it was, yeah, it was gross. It sucks. It sucks. Being our age and getting acne. It's the worst. What the fuck is happening? But it was because I was, I was still living in New York and it was like, it was raining every day and it was dark. And like, I just, it was, it was definitely related to weather. And I went and I did the Joker's cruise and it cleared up on the cruise. Yeah. Like it just cleared up immediately as soon as I got in the sun and there was like a saltwater pool. Bro, I had, I had a insane, like a rare skin disease when I was younger. That sucks. I get, yeah, just out of nowhere. I've told you that's peter Isis. Out of nowhere. I've never seen anything like it. It was just patches of red all over me and didn't itch. Didn't burn. It was nothing. Does it look like a red spot? Like sunburn? The first one does. There's a Harold patch that comes first. I was just looking at the mirror and I just had a big red mark here. Okay. And I was like, all right, whatever. I don't give a fuck. And then started multiplying. It was just all over me. Oh. But it was only where sun doesn't get you. So it's from your knees to your elbows. Like it was just where you wear clothes. Yeah. And then my family and I went to the beach. Clear it up. Clear it up. Did it ever. But I had to lay in public with a giant red skin rash. Yeah. Did it ever get like rashy and raised or was it always just like your skin? It was a little rashy and raised, but it still didn't itch or. Yeah. Yeah. I got you. Skin's fucking weird. Cause it is an organ. It's an organ on your body. You're right about dermatologists though. Like a dermatologist is a little bit like, yep, that's pretty gross. You know, here's some cream, you know, like in the cream, the reason you can't do it for more than two weeks is because a lot of it's, it will, it thins your skin. Yeah. And you buy what I've had with the creams. Use a lot. I have, I get a thing called sensitive. I get a thing called. Also, I've had it washed down to my balls and you know, and it like my ball skin is would go crazy from whatever they were giving me. Ball skin goes the craziest. Oh, ball skin. When it goes, the absolute, when that stuff goes down, you get dried out ball sack, bro, that's three years. It's the exact, that's not going away for three fucking years. It's the worst. Yeah. It sucks. I actually dealt with an armpit rash for an entire year last year. What were you using? A new deodorant with alcohol? it was the same old deodorants. I just, uh, it was almost like I got jock itch. Yes. I've gotten that before. And it just lingered. I think there's nothing worse than an armpit rash. Cause you have to put deodorant on it and it burns and it itches so bad. And you, you, I was plowing through it. I was just putting fucking, uh, antifungal cream on it. Filming tires. It was while we were filming. It went from the summer into when we were filming time. It was a nightmare. I don't wear it. I don't wear deodorant. I'll put it on like once every now and again. Do you not sweat though? I do. And I'll smell a little bit, but it's like, dude, my armpits get dry from deodorant. It's like, I fucking hate. I remember brute. Yeah. Dude, that stuff was flammable. I used to run it across the carpet and light it on fire and it would just go, make like a line. Jesus Christ. Sick. It was the carpet. I fucked up a beach rental when I was a little kid one time. Cause I would make designs in the carpet and like, you would light for two seconds. Just like little fight. Well, I didn't do the, I didn't do the, yeah. I didn't do the swat. You didn't do the coolest design possible to set on fire. I would do a little like loop de loop tracks. The one time it did get out of control. And I was like, fuck, fuck, fuck. How did your parents not know you were lighting the carpet on fire? I don't know. I would just do it. It was a beach trip. They were probably fucking shit face. But at one time I, yeah, they were. It was a beach trip. It was 11 a.m. They were blacked out at the beach. Yeah. Yeah. My parents never drank growing up. So they, they knew everything I was doing. I wish I had parents that fucking just got rocked. Sorry, I was a joke about it, but it is, it is the best. Yeah. I mean, you have a parent come home drunk. You go, Oh, for sure. This is a fun day. Yeah. Yeah. I missed out. Drunk dad is awesome. Your dad gets drunk when you're little. Although the first time I did get scared because I read a book in the library saying like, it was all about like, drunk and hitting your mom. So it was like, the book was called like, why does dad hit mom when he drinks? It was something like that. First time I saw my dad drunk, I was just like, he's beating the fuck out of my mom right now. And I was just a little coward. I just sat in my room. Like, I hope he doesn't go too hard on her. Yeah. He didn't at all. He was so friendly. He sat on the steps and cried. Yeah. I should go in there. He was just literally like, he would come in and be like, dad. I'd be like, well, dad, don't look at beat mom. Oh, that's great. Drunk dad. That's super friendly. Phil is still that. He gets, he comes home. He goes, fuck yeah. Then you see him in the morning. He's like, how are you? You're a fucking punk. Oh, you're hungover. You're being, I'm not hungover. He's never been hungover once. Hitting a girl with hungover is very funny. I've done it before. I'd be like, you're just hungover and being fucking great. I'm not even hungover at all. It's like, yeah, you're a little edgy. Everybody loves denying a hangover. Hey, it's crazy. Everybody's favorite thing to do is go. I'm not, you know, what's crazy. I feel pretty good. There you go. I'll tell you guys right now, I'm fucking hungover as shit. Really? Oh yeah. You put it on. That's why you asked how long this podcast was. No, no. I was just, I was literally just curious. Stop riding me, dude. That's too much lotion. That's thin skin. We were, we were in London in the van and you were fucking with me. I was like, back off, dude. You just kept going, I'm on your bumper, boy. I'm on your fucking bumper. You're trapped. You got three days in the UK. You're not going anywhere. You were on his ass in the UK. I was. It's so funny. Till we got off the flight. Till we landed back there. I mean, we were screaming in the fucking airport. Holy shit, dude. We got prime. I mean, you guys might have talked about it already, but we got prime O'Connor video over there. Yeah. We got some classics. Him at the height of his powers. Yeah. I saw him running through the streets of London. I'm from London. Like throwing shit. Yeah. He was a, he's a real problem. That's what I like about him though. He turns up that hard and then you won't see him for two weeks. He's got, he's got to mend himself. He goes home and he lays there. He enters the tent. Oh, I saw him last night. I got to read. I got to fucking cook. I got to become a good person. And then you go, why don't you come out? Yeah. Yeah. There's bounce backs are crazy. It's pretty impressive. I saw him last night. We were in the green room. We had two drinks and I was like, what are you doing, dude? He's like, I don't know. I might go see Sadie, whatever. And he fucking snuck out. I was like, he's dodging it. Yeah. He's trying to be good. You got to respect the dog. Yeah. I get it. I get it, man. I get it. I'm fucking terrible at it. I let everybody talk me into fucking hanging out. I am the worst. Yeah, but you do it. You do it just as much. You're one of the worst perpetrators of it. Yeah. Yeah. Come on, dude, take a shot. My birthday's next week. Yeah. I'm taking a thousand shots with you. And every time you go, you never take shots. It's, it's been literally years. Literally. We've, we've taken shots together. We took shots together last week at Mitzi's. I did not take any shots with you at Mitzi's. Yeah, we did. We did. Yeah. At the corner. Yeah. Shit. Well, you got me there. And you said it. I remember it. You go, you'd never take shots. My boy. We took shots for the last week. My dude. It's every week. It's so funny. It is usually late. Yeah. If I'm taking a shot. I was talking to Carrie at mothership last night about, she's like, what are you doing tomorrow, baby? I was like, I'm doing Matt and Shane. And, uh, I was just taught, telling her about when you just start pressuring to drink. And I was like, I'm going to be sitting on that couch. He's going to be like, come on, come on, let's get one. Come on. Let's go. I was like, she's like, wow. And I was like, I can't say no to the man. No, we got to, no, I can't today. I can't today. Stop, dude. No, stop, dude. No, I got spots tonight. No, I can't. Yeah. All right. I can't, I've got to remain in the tomb, dude. I put together a run. I got to. True. But I was just, I was like, Friday. True. I'll make it to Friday. I don't fly out till Saturday. Where are you headed? Uh, back up to PA. Cause I got to do some pods in New York and then Rhode Island gigs and, and then some other stuff.

Thank you. I appreciate it. And at first I didn't like the blurry shots and then I came around. All right. Thank you. I was a little on the fence about them too at first, but then the closer we got to, cause I was, I directed it too. So I was very involved from start to finish with everything. And, um, I was a little on the fence about it too, but then ultimately I was like, Oh no, it works. It's, it's, I don't know. It's, it was, you know, it was a nice device I thought or whatever, but, but yeah, man, I appreciate you. I missed the actual taping. I was at the after party. you showed up right as the party was starting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was bummed. I missed that. It was, it was a good, it was, I was thrilled. You, you came down, you rolled in with six, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's, I was thrilled you came down. Definitely got bullied into taking a shot. Well, it's always a special. Yeah. Yeah. It's always a special. Um, but, uh, yeah, it's called, I never promised you a rose garden. It's on my YouTube at Joe, at Joe, the Rosa. So youtube.com slash at Joe, the Rosa comedy. Uh, but anyway, I hope people enjoy it. Yeah, it's good. But, uh, I was, that's the hardest. It's a really good special. Thank you, dude. It means a lot to me to hear you say that because, and Matt, feel free to jump in with the compliment. I, I, I haven't seen it yet. So I always feel bad. I don't see it. And I usually, and I usually, uh, fuck, fuck, fuck. Don't watch. I watched yours a lot. I haven't finished it yet, but I've watched a lot of it. I'm not blowing smoke up your ass. I did the same thing with you. Like, I was like, you're one of, no, no, no, no. I'm saying though, like, I don't, I hear you. It's like, it's, it's kind of hard sometimes when you do comedy and you're around it all the time to jump into a special. But you're one of the guys where it's like, I'm like, I was like excited. And we've done enough shows where I know the material. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was, it was stoked. Ask Ardini. He told me his special. I'm like, that's going to be awesome. I can't wait to see that. Thanks guys. They were actually singing your praises before you got in. Thanks guys. I really appreciate it. How much they liked the, I heard the way it started out and I was like, awesome. The starting, the starting bit of material. I was like, that's, let's not, let's not get any spoilers, but I can't wait for the start of your special. Yeah. Can't wait. No spoilers. No spoilers. But yeah, I heard, I was here and I was like, that's thanks brother. Perfect. Thanks dude. It's the, it's, it's literally the hardest I ever worked on anything in my whole life. That's like those three years of, uh, of touring and I was going to shoot it at one point. And Ari Shafir was like, it's not ready. It's not ready yet. It's not ready. You know? And then like when I finally did do it, like him being like, it's like I did it to, I was like, all right. That's awesome. Good for him for, cause that's hard to tell someone. But boy, if somebody told me it's not ready when I thought it was ready. We argued. I mean, me and Ari did argue. I wasn't just like, okay. Yeah. I was like, it's ready, dude. I don't need to do it for three years. And he goes, he goes, oh yeah, cause you're the one. And I was like, God damn. All right. But, but yeah, like you, but I don't know. It's like, it's nice having friends. Like again, I'm not blowing smoke, but it's nice having friends who also do comedy that when they put something out, like when you put out your last one, you're excited to watch it. Cause it's like, yeah, it's easy to get. I have a friend who sucked. Yes. Like check out this special. Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited for yours, dude. Thank you, man. Yeah.

I don't know. I don't know what the fuck the joke is. I kept saying last night, I was like, he should have dressed me up, man. He should have dressed me up. I could have done that. I was like, I could have done that. I know the joke easily could have been NHL. I know. No, no. Or NASCAR. Or golf. you mean fucking. Let me put that shit on, dude. Well, then we wouldn't be talking right now, but we would be considered the greatest of all time. We wouldn't still be talking. I just showed up fully prepared for the role. What the fuck are you doing? We can save it. Oh, I thought she was like, what the joke's about? Oh shit. I got to take this off. Fuck. It's not coming off. It was, it was fun for me to watch it again. I'm sitting next to Jalen Carter. Fuck. I'm just like a black lady. Dude, I saw the rewatching it and seeing the people behind us, like clapping in earnest. And then it's revealed and they go, that was very, very fun to see. The, uh, fucking asshole.

Yeah. That's enough to, so like after the ESPYs, I had to go do Kansas city and Oklahoma city. Yeah. And those, you know, you're doing a show like that. That's, that's a lot of fucking stress. I don't know how you also, I flew home on Friday and I for real thought I was going to fall down. Friday sucked ass. Oh fuck. Yeah. I had a later flight. Yeah. But like not that much later. I texted these guys like we're already there. I was walking through the airport. Like I felt like I was like not getting enough oxygen. That's how it feels. Because you were just so hung over to me. I didn't have like the headache or anything, but I was just, I had like three hours, two hours of liquor fast. Yes. I had like two hours of sleep and just walking through the airport with like my bag. Just like I for real might go down. I was like lightheaded. Bro. It's so bad. So that day I woke up in the hotel going, yes, I have nothing to do today. Perfect. And then I was like, oh shit, I got to fly to Oklahoma and do a show. Then the next morning I woke up like finally I can fucking go home. Fuck. I got to go to Kansas fucking city. God damn it. Yeah. I don't know what's going on. I guess this is what being burnt out is, but yeah. Anxious like dreams. Yeah. And then I wake up going, I don't have anything to do. Nice. Fuck. Dude, you just did a thing that six people have done. It was the movie. Yeah. The movie filming a movie for a month and a half was, yeah, I've never done anything like that. Yeah. And then shows. And then the, yeah, you're running through a very unique. It's time to, it's time to lay down. Yeah. Yeah. And oh yeah. And we filmed commercials that I'm seeing the edits to those. I don't fucking love them. I go, oh great. Yeah. There's nothing worse than watching yourself in a way where you're like, I don't like that. While you're anxious and hung over and you see a video of yourself, you go, it sucks. It was fun. I was trying to upload all of this stuff from our drunk podcast that next day in the airport. I'll just watch it and be like, Oh, the anxiety of that podcast. Thank you. With the second half, the second half's in the tomb forever. NFT. Until, until one day. Yeah. We're going to sell it to Martin Screlly for $6 million. $6 million. Yeah. Yeah. No, that, that airport hangover. Oh, like, like, honestly, I like almost have a panic attack. Yeah. I carry Xanax for it. Cause, cause you're, it's so like, your gut is related to your anxiety and all that shit. And when you're in that state, you're walking, you're like, you might have to take a shit. You don't know. Yeah. And then that's shit at any moment. Yeah. It's hard. You could. No, I mean, physically, I could walk into a bathroom and take a shit while hung over at any, if someone said take a shit right now, I go, no problem. Oh, you mean like on command? Yes. Oh, that's great. One's chambered at all times. Yeah. All right. Yes, sir. That'll help me. Yes, Danny. Yes, Danny. Yeah. That's just so good. I'm like, I'm like a hundred. You can't handle a clear gay joke. I'm 103 degrees. My face is, I have like 103 degree fever. And then I just woke up and I did the opposite. I pounded coffee to like power through. So nothing like heart palpitation. It was terrible. Yeah. Heart palpitation. It was terrible. It's fucking nuts. Then, you know, the B-dubs at the airport's just right there going. It is. Yeah. You're nothing without me, coward. When I did, when I did, I did, I did kill Tony when they did the HEB center down here. I did the panel and I was only supposed to do a set. And then I showed up and he was like, I need you to panel buddy. And I was like, all right. And I was so hung over. And I started the same thing, dude, dehydrated. I felt like sick. I felt like I had a cold. I started fucking pounding coffee to wake up. And then I was meeting it with booze to get like tuned up. Dude, I got on stage. My gut started turning. My hand to God, dude, I had a two minute panic attack on stage. I was sitting there. I was so, I was hitting me from all angles. And I was sitting there. The first bucket pull came out. The kid was talking to us. And my brain was like, it's a lot of fucking people out there, dude. It was all lit up. If you watch the video, you see me do this. You see, this is the desk. And I just go like this. I just put the mic down. I just stare. I'm going to freak out right now. I was like, I was literally looking like, where can I run off this fucking stage? That's tough. And then it just, it just stopped. And I was like, oh, that's hangover. That's like bad anxiety. I get that doing standup. Where like, I'll like forget the next thing I'm going to talk about. And it's like a 30 second thing in my head where it's like, this is it, dude. You're going to have to look at all these people and go, I can't do this. I'm sorry, guys. I don't know why I just walk off and you just power through and you're like, all right, thank God. no, I've been there, dude. Maria Bamford said she used to like, she said she would like take comfort in knowing that at any second she, she had the option of running out of the club and never returned. She was like, that's the only way I can get through it. Like sometimes. Yeah. It's like, fuck. It is nice. When you get on stage and you go, oh yeah, I can do standup. Yeah. After the first like minute you go, oh fuck you. Yeah. Nice. Cause for the last hour and a half, I've been back there going, fuck. I can't do this. Oh fuck. Yeah. Yeah. I've done the coffee, pre-show coffee to where I'm on stage and my heart's like, and I'm like, all right, I'm going to fucking, this, this might be it. And then I've done it where I'm like, maybe I have a heart attack. And I really leaned into it and powered through. And I was like, I was so proud of myself. I was so proud of myself. I had horrible pain in my chest. I was headlining. It was like two years ago. It might've been two or three years ago. You might've had a heart attack. Bro. It hurt. It hurt so bad that I, I was like, I have to get off stage. Yeah. And then I was like, well, this is my last joke. Just fucking. And I just did my last joke, got off stage. I was like, I'm pretty sure I just had a heart attack up there. Yeah. And you never got a check or anything? Nah. People have little ones. That's something. I don't, I don't think it was an actual heart attack. I think. People go in the doctor like, dude, you've had like three heart attacks. You're like, what? I was 34. Dude, I know someone who got one at like 24 years old. I mean, they were, they were taking heavy subs and then other recreationals, but. Yeah. I was on zero recreationals. Yeah. If you can have them without knowing, I've definitely had them. If that's an option, there's no way I haven't had heart attacks. There's no way. Well, if I ever had one, that was it. Yeah. I mean, that sounds like hard. I've never had something that hurt. Like my fucking wall. I'll be like, ah, it's like, oh, I'll tell you. I'll tell you. Fuck. I'll tell you a perfect formula for, I'm going to have a heart attack on stage. This has happened to me several times. You'll be at mothership. You'll be in the green room. You look up and realize the guy on stage in the main room only has 30 seconds left. And you go, oh fuck. And you run all the way. Dude, you get on stage. I've done that. I can't catch my breath on stage. Dude, I'll do this on the stool. I'll lean like this. And I swear to God the whole time, I'm like, I think I'm going to have a heart attack right now. That is a fucking labyrinth back there. Yeah. You got to go up and down five flights of steps. I felt bad last night because we're all backstage. And I, people are backstage. Like you were backstage and you had, you probably had like four minutes. I'll say something. It was eight. I was like, I always go bro. But I feel like a dick because I'm like, Hey, DeRosa, you're up next, right? He's like, yeah, I'm going down. I'm like, I feel like an asshole. Like I'm like, dude, you better get down there. No, I do it. I do it. I do it on shows. I'm not even on. I get nervous. I'll be like, yo, I think I was fucking. Yeah, dude, I get nervous on other people's behalf. You never know when someone's going to fucking just go. That's it. I know. It was GD and he have GD and he dug his heel. Obviously, luckily he's a big stage hug. Doug his heels in. Yeah. Yeah. You actually probably were like, Oh, GD is always going to get along. I was nervous when it's like eight minutes in, I see the clock and I'm going like, dude, it's a while to get down there. Did you ever go on stage there and you realize you forget the dude you're bringing on his last name for sure? Yeah. And you're like, I forgot the headliners. Joe Rogan. Fucking Joe. This podcast is an experience. It's got an experience. It's the. Dude. The other McDonald clip fucked me up. Did you ever see her go down? Yeah. I think about that. Yeah. I watch it. I go. Cause I, you know, I've obviously laughed about it publicly. So it's like, I'm like, that's going to happen to me now. It's going to happen. Dude. There's, there's a, there's a trilogy. There's a perfect trilogy. Uh, Heather McDonald. Yeah. Wendy Williams. uh, Gallagher. Oh, and you're forgetting the goat, Pablo Francisco. He went down. Did he collapse on stage? No, but he says that that's a wild meltdown. Yeah. Yeah. That's a wild. That's the, that's the number one for me. He broke. Well, well, we've had, you've heard me say it a million times. You don't think I can get out of this? Oh, okay. So, Oh no, you're in good. You're in safe hands. Get down. Get to the chopper. You don't think I can get out of this folks? There's some of the videos that cuts and then it cuts them being, that's the one that made me. Yeah. Yeah. Just straight to the airport. Stretch a gun. You don't think I can get out of this? Oh no. Oh no. He got locked in a bit. He got locked in the bit. Dude, he's in like a K hole with a bit. No. Yeah. Like, he can't get out of this bit. And he's gone. I can, I can, I can, but like, wait, hold on. Oh, this is, this is fun. He's at the hospital. Like, it's not funny. Let it go. It's like, no, it's funny. I can get to the end of the bit. Just let me finish the fucking bit. Let's keep interrupting. Top three. So that's, that's stage meltdowns. That's a different category though. That's, but that's right. That's the number one of meltdowns. Two, two might go to Swartzen. Did you just say Swartzen? Swartzen was awesome. He's just like, so, all right. He's so high. He can't even like make sentences. And the lady just comes out and pulls him off stage. Dude, that's, dude, that's in the background of my head the entire time. Oh, you're about to, here it comes, dude. You're about to start rambling incoherently. Oh my God. I thought the O'Conn man was going to have one. He, when we did the Chicago theater, he went out with Santino during the day. Oh, Jesus Christ. I went out, I met him. I had like one beer and I was like, we got Chicago theater tonight. Yeah. Yeah. I left. They show up. They didn't, they didn't leave. He never went back to the hotel. They went from the bars straight to the show. O'Conn man walks in the green room. Like, so I was like, Holy shit, dude, you're blacked out. And I was like, fine, dude, get the fuck out there. Go out there. Yeah. He killed. That's awesome. God damn. That's pretty impressive. That's awesome. Oh, dude, he's from a fucking another dimension, man. He is. O'Connor should be in the next mortal combat. He really does. He might be the drunken master. That's insane. Wait, third, but wait, they got a number three best meltdown. The Lampanelli one is wild. Do you remember that one? it happened. Where people are walking out and then people are helping her. People are going like, she's yelling at somebody and then people are being like, it's okay, lace. And she's like, shut the fuck up. I don't need any fucking help from you. And she's like turning on people supporting her and shit. Like, it's a, I'm not throwing any shade. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This could happen to any of us. Yeah. We're just, it's just funny. Like I've, I've, I have, I've been banned from clubs. I've freaked on stage. Yeah. You're a psycho. Yeah. Yeah. You're a wild dog. Yeah. I got banned from the laugh factory in New York. Did you really? Yeah. Cause I told the audience, I said, I hope you all get fucking AIDS and die in a car accident on your way home tonight. You're a bunch of fucking animals. I got banned. It's probably during like a decent set. I was just at the end. They were, it was so rowdy, dude. It was crazy how rowdy it was. Yeah. And then I went back to the club, like, and I was like, I don't understand why you won't book me anymore. And the booker was like, because you told the audience, I hope you get AIDS and die in a fucking car. Do you, do you think that's okay? I was like, well, they weren't, they were shit. I don't know. What was I supposed to do? Yeah. I've freaked. Have you guys ever freaked? I've, I've lost my shit. I've spazzed. I've never spazzed. The only one that's Fort Wayne was, I was just like, all right, that's good. It's the end of the show. I haven't done it in 15 years. Like I learned. I did it now. Bakersfield. That was a tough one. Spazz. They were, they were wild. I spazzed on one guy in Phoenix, Arizona. I like kind of just started traveling headlining and the weekend wasn't going well. Ticket sales weren't great. And then there was like in this, the, one of the rooms is a copper blues. There was a, they have like multiple ones. I think there's one of those rooms. Where there's like, you know, like seating, but then they have booths to like the right of the stage. Yeah. So it was just a guy in a fucking like leather jacket talking. So fucking loud. the, what was it called? It's not the, it's around there. It's. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. They have multiple, but this guy was talking and it was just like, you know, I was like, whatever, like shut up. But then at one point, Brittany went up to him. She was there. It was like, he'd be quiet. And he said something to her. And I like, just stopped mid joke. It was like, shut the fuck up pussy. And like spaz. It was like a fight. Fuck yeah. It was bad. And I was like, anyway, I was just fucking around guys. Yeah. Pure, pure red face spaz had him. Cause like eventually I think I had him come up on stage and he just called me gay without a microphone. I'm like, it just backfired on me. And I was like, look up and get up here. And he's like, you're just a fucking gay pussy. And I'm like, damn, nice jacket, bitch. Get off the stage. This isn't working. It's just go straight. Gay guy. Well, your jacket is discussing. Fuck you. He told me at an Uber driver, you have an Uber driver jacket, dude, get the fuck out of here. But it was just, they're always right around. He was getting louder though. He was winning the debate. I'm like, get the fuck out of here. He's like, you're fucking gay. That was, that was, it wasn't really a spaz, but in that Tempe improv, uh, that was where that gremlin from high school got me. Oh, you remember that? This kid from high school showed up and he was like, after the first show, he's sitting in the green room. He's like, I would give that like a C, C minus. Oh, and then he spent an hour in between shows talking about how I sucked at football in his class. And then stayed. It was crazy. I mean, I don't know how you didn't choke him. Other people were looking like, yeah, what the, what the fuck's going on? I don't know how you didn't choke him. And then he, uh, stayed for the second show and I killed. And every time I had a good joke, I just looked directly at him. Just gone. Yeah. Yeah. C minus. You little fucker. Every single joke for an hour. I was just, every time I'm going, what do you think of that? What do you think of that? You fucking cock. He was like that. Nothing to him. He was like, that was good. Oh, that was, now that was good. I love how people like that. Flip it. Now that was good. See, go fuck yourself. I'm like your coach. Yeah. That's weird. a spaz is always right around the corner. I've, I've without question in recent year, when I, I, I'm speaking way too, uh, uh, liberally when I say I learned my lesson, because I, I'll still yell at an audience, but I figured out somehow to sometimes make it kind of funny to like beat them in to get, but like, I, I could easily see having a full, having a full freak at any, you know, it's, it's, it's, it won't take much, dude. It doesn't take much. It's a couple of annoying people. Let's start getting to your shows, you know? Yeah. What's that? Let's start hanging around the back of your shows. I mean, I just want to, I fucking sucks. The ultimate, I just want to be clear that I stand with Pablo, Lisa. Oh, for sure. For sure. Yeah. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not making fun of it. It's funny to see though. I'm con, I'm convinced it will happen. I'm like, it's, I'm going to join the pantheon of dudes who freak out one day and just completely break and be like, I don't know why I do this. I'm sorry guys. Please refund everything. I'm fighting it the entire time. I do anything. The, but wait, you never saw Gallagher having the heart attack on stage. Yeah. It's during the fucking watermelon. No. He walks over, picks. It's just so fucked up to laugh at him. It's fucking hilarious. Yeah. No, he goes over to the water. He picks up the hammer and he goes, Oh, fuck. No. He goes down. Oh, he goes down. He goes down. He has a fucking heart attack. He has a real one. Yeah, dude. Oh, that's what I was saying. There was two categories. There's collapse on stage versus meltdown. I mean, a prop. Yeah. Cause Heather McDonald's was pretty fucking elite. Hers was crazy. Cause she was like, I got all the vaccine. What? Oh, sorry. Good prop guy going down. Oh, it's crazy. With a hammer, a mallet in your hand over his head. Like the watermelon finally won. The watermelon was like, he's literally doing a thing that would give any human a heart attack. He's doing it on stage. It's closer. Yeah, dude. Exactly. Time was finally like, that's enough, dude. Yeah. But wait, did Heather McDonald ever explain what happened to her? I haven't seen the explanation. No. I'm sure she talked about it somewhere, but I never, I've never saw it addressed at all. She just fainted. Yeah. But it was like, she just happened to be talking about how boosted she was. That was the worst part. I just jinxed it. Yeah. True. Wait, what was she talking about? She was talking, she was bragging about how many. Her last lines were like how many boosters and how many times she's gotten the vaccine. Then her last line's like, so yeah, Jesus loves me. Yeah. And the worst part was the crowd thought it was a bit and they were like, yeah, it's timed perfectly. Yeah. It was fucked up. Yeah. That's a great bit. That's true. But yeah, I think she really got hurt. She fucking, I think she hit her head. Dude, she got fucked up. Yeah. She had a skull fracture. Yeah. God. Yeah. She got fucked up and it was just like these idiots who didn't get the vaccine. Ha ha. I've gotten all of them. Ha ha. God loves me. I've never even gotten. Ha ha. And fucking. Literally got killed. God was just like, yeah, yeah, enough of that. Holy shit. Jesus Christ. Yeah. The Wendy Williams one happened on TV. Yeah. I saw that. Yeah. By the way, she was sick. Wendy Williams rules. She does. I didn't know Wendy Williams ruled. I don't know. I don't know much about her. Watch clips. She's fucking hilarious. Yeah. She is funny. She's doing, she's doing a show at comics in New York. Were you around when comics was there? Oh my God. I'm going to pee my fucking pants. Yeah. I'm going to pee my pants too. We take a break. I can't move, dude. We'll see you later. Are we in an hour? Yeah. Oh, dude, let's slide to the page. Yeah. I've been fighting it for like 10 minutes. I could have been page right there. We'll see. Yeah, true. It was a lot of standup talk. Okay. We'll see. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.

[148.48 - 149.58] SPEAKER_04:  Obviously,  wearing  SWAT  gear.
[150.30 - 151.36] SPEAKER_03:  Just  that  alone.  Everyone
[151.36 - 158.94] SPEAKER_04:  wants  to  wear  SWAT  tactical  gear.  Although,  ever  since  I  saw  the  picture  of  Big  Chungus  at  the  protest  during  BLM,  I  realized  I  could  never  rock  the  SWAT  gear.
[159.26 - 162.36] SPEAKER_03:  What?  Too  big  to  wear  SWAT  gear.  How  so?
[163.46 - 170.26] SPEAKER_04:  When  you're  a  big  guy  in  SWAT  gear,  it  looks  fucking  hilarious.  Have  you  ever  seen  it?  Have  you  ever  seen  a  big,  fat  guy  in  SWAT  gear?
[170.30 - 171.12] SPEAKER_03:  Never  thought  about  it.  I
[171.12 - 171.12] SPEAKER_04:  don't
[171.12 - 171.18] SPEAKER_03:  know.
[171.26 - 171.86] SPEAKER_04:  I'll  show  you  Big
[171.86 - 174.08] SPEAKER_03:  Chungus.  I  feel  like  you  would  look  like  a  juggernaut.
[175.12 - 175.94] SPEAKER_04:  There  is  that.
[176.04 - 176.26] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah.
[176.48 - 183.02] SPEAKER_04:  There  is  that.  I  could  wear  the  Hurt  Locker  fucking...  And  just  be  juggernaut.  But  juggernaut  sucks.  You  get  shot  fucking  nine  million  times.
[184.16 - 185.28] SPEAKER_02:  You  play  games,  man?
[186.06 - 190.44] SPEAKER_03:  No,  I  can't  have  it,  man.  I  won't  stop  playing  it.  It's  like  a  complete  time  suck.  You  got  a
[190.44 - 191.42] SPEAKER_02:  full  family,  too.
[191.62 - 191.98] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah.
[192.80 - 195.36] SPEAKER_02:  I'd  imagine  there's  not  a  ton  of...  But  wait,  do  you  play  with  the  kids,  though?
[195.82 - 197.32] SPEAKER_03:  Not  yet.  It's  getting  there,  though.
[197.68 - 198.04] SPEAKER_02:  There
[198.04 - 201.30] SPEAKER_03:  could  be  some  aerial  cart  with  a  five -year -old  soon.  Yo.
[201.78 - 202.00] SPEAKER_02:  He  can't
[202.00 - 202.36] SPEAKER_04:  be  the
[202.36 - 202.96] SPEAKER_02:  chungus.
[205.78 - 206.14] SPEAKER_03:  That's
[206.14 - 207.80] SPEAKER_04:  insane.  He  can't  be  the  big  chungus.
[207.80 - 209.64] SPEAKER_03:  He  didn't  have  the  right  gear.  His  gear  is  too  small.
[210.26 - 210.94] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah,  it's
[210.94 - 211.30] SPEAKER_02:  a  tough  one.
[211.32 - 211.32] SPEAKER_03:  Getting
[211.32 - 211.46] SPEAKER_02:  too
[211.46 - 213.26] SPEAKER_03:  fat  for  your  tactical  gear  would  be  tough.
[213.60 - 214.00] SPEAKER_02:  Yeah.
[214.16 - 219.38] SPEAKER_03:  Because  then  it's  literally  life  or  death.  You  have  viscera  exposed.  Yeah,  that  looks  like
[219.38 - 232.86] SPEAKER_02:  when  they  brought  back  Boba  Fett,  but  he  was  fat  now.  And  they  didn't  adjust  the  costume.  It  was  like  up  here.  Some  Australian  dude  has  just  been  drinking  for  10  years.  And  they're  like,  you  want  to  do  the  role  again?  He's  like,  yeah.
[233.10 - 241.58] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah.  I've  been  waiting  on  this  call.  Fuck.  His  helmet's  like  a  yarmulke  on  his  head.  I  don't  know.  Boba  Fett  was  an  Australian  man?
[242.02 - 244.38] SPEAKER_02:  Or  he  might  be  from...  Because  if  that's  the
[244.38 - 245.38] SPEAKER_04:  case,  he  lives  actually  on
[245.38 - 246.96] SPEAKER_02:  Tatooine.  I  think  he's  New  Zealand.
[247.02 - 247.40] SPEAKER_04:  Oh,  okay.
[247.76 - 253.10] SPEAKER_02:  Yeah.  That  guy,  he  was  in  that  movie  When  We  Were  Kings,  which  I  feel  like  is...  I  don't
[253.10 - 254.18] SPEAKER_04:  even  think  I've  heard  of  that  movie.
[255.00 - 262.32] SPEAKER_02:  As  I  was  saying  it,  I  was  like,  I  feel  like  Shane,  this  is  a  movie  Shane  would  love,  but  I'm  basing  that  only  on  the  title,  When  We  Were  Kings.  It's  just  a  movie  you
[262.32 - 262.64] SPEAKER_04:  would  love.
[262.68 - 262.68] SPEAKER_02:  It's  just
[262.68 - 264.64] SPEAKER_04:  a  drunk  guy.  Fucking  every  night.
[265.44 - 265.84] SPEAKER_02:  We
[265.84 - 266.42] SPEAKER_04:  Were  Kings.
[266.54 - 266.94] SPEAKER_02:  Yeah,
[266.94 - 266.94] SPEAKER_04:  what's
[266.94 - 267.46] SPEAKER_02:  the  movie  about?
[267.50 - 267.50] SPEAKER_04:  We
[267.50 - 267.88] SPEAKER_02:  were  the
[267.88 - 274.58] SPEAKER_04:  fucking  best.  What's  it  about?  The  movie  takes  place  at  a  bus
[274.58 - 274.84] SPEAKER_02:  stop.
[275.38 - 277.00] SPEAKER_03:  It  takes  place  at  a  bus  stop  in  West
[277.00 - 277.34] SPEAKER_04:  Philadelphia.
[277.86 - 278.66] SPEAKER_02:  Yeah.  We  Was  Kings.
[279.20 - 279.26] SPEAKER_03:  We
[279.26 - 279.26] SPEAKER_02:  Was  Kings.
[279.26 - 279.34] SPEAKER_03:  I
[279.34 - 279.58] SPEAKER_04:  think
[279.58 - 279.80] SPEAKER_02:  it's
[279.80 - 280.06] SPEAKER_03:  about
[280.06 - 281.04] SPEAKER_04:  like...  I
[281.04 - 285.84] SPEAKER_02:  think  it's  kind  of  like  Slumdog  Millionaire,  except  in  New  Zealand,  or  one  of
[285.84 - 287.22] SPEAKER_04:  those  kind  of  movies.  Okay.
[287.40 - 289.66] SPEAKER_02:  I  think,  or  like  City  of  God,  maybe  it's  like  that.
[289.78 - 290.60] SPEAKER_04:  City  of  God's  awesome.
[290.90 - 293.16] SPEAKER_02:  I've  never  seen  either  movie.  I  heard  they're  both  great.
[293.44 - 295.58] SPEAKER_04:  City  of  God's  awesome.  Yeah.  It's
[295.58 - 298.62] SPEAKER_02:  a  great  title.  I  like  subtitles,  man.  I'm  a
[298.62 - 300.00] SPEAKER_04:  big  subtitle  movie  guy.  I
[300.00 - 300.32] SPEAKER_02:  like  that.
[300.62 - 302.54] SPEAKER_04:  Let's  talk  movies.  What?
[302.80 - 305.94] SPEAKER_02:  Let's  talk  movies  we've  never  seen.  Let's  talk  movies.  City  of  God.
[306.14 - 307.70] SPEAKER_04:  City  of  God  rules.  You'd  like  it.
[308.48 - 312.02] SPEAKER_02:  Wait.  I  want  to  look  up  when  we  were...  I'm  going  to  look  it  up  at  one  point.
[312.54 - 312.94] SPEAKER_04:  When
[312.94 - 313.14] SPEAKER_02:  We
[313.14 - 313.32] SPEAKER_04:  Were
[313.32 - 313.46] SPEAKER_03:  Kings
[313.46 - 313.46] SPEAKER_02:  is  actually...
[313.46 - 313.58] SPEAKER_03:  What
[313.58 - 313.58] SPEAKER_02:  would
[313.58 - 313.90] SPEAKER_03:  be  the  best
[313.90 - 314.56] SPEAKER_04:  movie  analysis
[314.56 - 317.24] SPEAKER_03:  ever?  I  don't  know  what  it's  about.  It's  like  two  movies
[317.24 - 317.46] SPEAKER_04:  I've
[317.46 - 317.98] SPEAKER_02:  never  seen  before.
[317.98 - 317.98] SPEAKER_03:  I  think
[317.98 - 318.14] SPEAKER_02:  it's  a
[318.14 - 318.38] SPEAKER_04:  guy
[318.38 - 318.96] SPEAKER_02:  from
[318.96 - 319.86] SPEAKER_04:  New
[319.86 - 320.88] SPEAKER_03:  Zealand.  I
[320.88 - 323.24] SPEAKER_02:  just  saw  one  of  the  shittiest  movies  I've  ever  fucking  seen.
[323.46 - 323.48] SPEAKER_03:  What?
[325.46 - 325.98] SPEAKER_02:  Opus.
[326.80 - 327.74] SPEAKER_03:  The  new  John
[327.74 - 328.58] SPEAKER_02:  Malkovich  movie.
[329.12 - 329.32] SPEAKER_03:  Never
[329.32 - 329.42] SPEAKER_02:  seen
[329.42 - 329.42] SPEAKER_03:  it.
[329.42 - 333.72] SPEAKER_02:  Where?  All  right.  Let  me  just  shoot  the  premise  at  you.
[333.94 - 334.34] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah.  And
[334.34 - 348.48] SPEAKER_02:  you'll  immediately  know  we're  off  to  a  bad  start.  John  Malkovich  plays  a  once  famous  R &B  pop  singer.  What?  How
[348.48 - 349.60] SPEAKER_03:  does  he  do  that?  Who
[349.60 - 358.08] SPEAKER_02:  disappears.  He  was  big  in  the  80s.  And  then  he  disappears  and  comes  back  30  years  later  for  his  opus.  He's  putting  out  another  album  after  30  years  of  absence.
[358.26 - 358.86] SPEAKER_04:  That  always  works.
[359.26 - 361.22] SPEAKER_02:  Yeah.  And  it's  John  Malkovich.
[362.56 - 367.44] SPEAKER_03:  Damn.  It'd  be  nice  if  it  was  like  late  Kells.  Like,  yo  pussy  is  a  buffet.  I  love  your  pussy.
[368.30 - 372.16] SPEAKER_02:  I  thought  they  were  going  to  make  him  like  a,  you  know,  like  a  fucking  Pink  Floyd -y  dude.
[372.34 - 372.74] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah.  When  I
[372.74 - 377.30] SPEAKER_02:  heard  the  premise.  And  I'm  like,  oh  no,  he's  like  a  dance  singer.  Like  a  fucking  like,
[377.54 - 377.82] SPEAKER_03:  like,
[377.94 - 391.58] SPEAKER_02:  like,  it's  so.  And  then  they,  so  all  these  people  get  invited  to  his  big  compound  to  listen  to  the  record.  And  then  everybody  starts  dying.  And  it's,  it's,  it's  Get  Out.  It's  like  the  57th  time  they've  remade  Get  Out  since  fucking  Get  Out  came  out.
[391.74 - 392.10] SPEAKER_04:  What?
[393.02 - 395.32] SPEAKER_02:  Sucks  dick.  It  is  a  terrible  fucking  movie.
[395.54 - 396.58] SPEAKER_04:  Who's  the  villain?  Who's,
[396.58 - 398.90] SPEAKER_02:  who's  the.  He  is.  You're
[398.90 - 400.42] SPEAKER_04:  describing  a  pretty  sick  fucking  movie.
[400.60 - 404.48] SPEAKER_02:  You'd  think.  You'd  think.  It  fucking  sucks.  It  also
[404.48 - 409.90] SPEAKER_04:  sounds  like  an  event  that  me  and  my  squad  should  probably  breach  and.  Yes.
[410.22 - 410.30] SPEAKER_02:  Yeah.
[410.88 - 411.34] SPEAKER_03:  Tie  up  the
[411.34 - 416.16] SPEAKER_04:  civilians.  Make  sure  everybody's  taken  care  of.  You  could  have  stopped  it.  I  could  have  stopped  it.  You  could
[416.16 - 416.98] SPEAKER_03:  have  stopped  the  onslaught.
[417.06 - 419.92] SPEAKER_04:  There's  going  to  be  some  people.  This  game's  a  hit,  dude.
[420.12 - 420.62] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah.  There's  going
[420.62 - 420.62] SPEAKER_04:  to
[420.62 - 421.14] SPEAKER_03:  be  some  people
[421.14 - 422.48] SPEAKER_04:  breaching  some  houses.
[422.64 - 423.34] SPEAKER_03:  You  think  so?  I
[423.34 - 427.56] SPEAKER_04:  think  so.  Because  it  does.  It  gives  you  that.  Yeah.
[427.86 - 432.30] SPEAKER_03:  Desire.  Yeah.  Your  ex -wife's  got  a  new  boyfriend.  That  would  be.  You  get  four  of  your  boys.
[432.42 - 433.66] SPEAKER_04:  You  go.  All  right.  Stack  the  door.
[434.02 - 434.12] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah.
[435.38 - 435.52] SPEAKER_04:  They
[435.52 - 436.80] SPEAKER_03:  should  be  doing  school  drop  off.
[437.38 - 438.94] SPEAKER_04:  Fucking  shock  on  the  lock.  Fraggit.
[439.32 - 441.28] SPEAKER_03:  745.  They  haven't  left  yet.  They  should  be  doing  drop  off  right
[441.28 - 441.66] SPEAKER_04:  now.  We're  going
[441.66 - 441.88] SPEAKER_03:  in.
[442.52 - 454.86] SPEAKER_02:  I  think  they.  I  don't  think  I'm  making  this  up.  Didn't  they  use  Forza  to  actually  train  race  drivers?  Didn't  they  actually  play  fucking  Forza  as  like  a  simulation  before  they  got  on  the  actual
[454.86 - 455.08] SPEAKER_04:  road?
[455.30 - 455.30] SPEAKER_02:  I'm  not
[455.30 - 456.86] SPEAKER_04:  sure.  Probably.  Gran  Turismo.  Yeah.
[457.02 - 458.42] SPEAKER_02:  Oh,  Gran  Turismo.  That's  what  it  was.
[458.54 - 459.58] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah.  That  makes  sense.  That's  insane,
[459.68 - 469.78] SPEAKER_02:  though,  that  games  are  getting  like.  I  actually  think  what  you're  saying  is  I  think  like  these  games  actually  could  be  like  tactical  training  before  you're  in  the  field.  I
[469.78 - 470.08] SPEAKER_04:  mean.
[470.34 - 470.70] SPEAKER_02:  You  know?
[470.96 - 477.70] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah.  Nate's  all.  I  would  have  failed.  Fucking  civilian  came  running  around  the  corner.  I  was  like,  oh.  He
[477.70 - 479.06] SPEAKER_03:  was  running  right  at  me.  Everybody
[479.06 - 479.56] SPEAKER_04:  saw  that.
[479.62 - 480.58] SPEAKER_03:  Scared  the  shit  out  of  me.
[480.90 - 481.96] SPEAKER_04:  They  do  scare  you.
[482.14 - 483.58] SPEAKER_03:  How  do  you  distinguish?  There's
[483.58 - 487.00] SPEAKER_04:  a.  Oh,  the  worst  one.  There's  like  a  for  real.  There's  like  a  pulse  nightclub.
[488.36 - 489.64] SPEAKER_03:  What?  And
[489.64 - 499.82] SPEAKER_04:  the  thing  that  they  did  in  the  game  that  always  fucked  me  up  from  the  actual  shooting  that  people  described  it  was  everyone's  phones  going  off.  That  was  dead.
[500.40 - 500.80] SPEAKER_03:  Whoa.
[500.98 - 504.64] SPEAKER_04:  Like  when  the  cops  went  in  to  clear  it  out,  you  could  just  hear  every  phone  in  the  building  buzzing,
[504.64 - 505.56] SPEAKER_02:  which  is
[505.56 - 506.32] SPEAKER_04:  so  sad.
[506.54 - 507.78] SPEAKER_02:  Yeah.  I  didn't  think  about  that.  And  they
[507.78 - 509.46] SPEAKER_04:  kept  that  in  the  game.  That's  in  the  game.
[509.58 - 509.88] SPEAKER_02:  Oh,
[510.14 - 511.78] SPEAKER_04:  it's  like  a  fucked  up  game.  Yeah,
[511.92 - 512.50] SPEAKER_02:  man.  Shit.
[513.20 - 513.70] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah.  That
[513.70 - 518.78] SPEAKER_02:  used  to  be.  They  used  that  used  to  get  a  lot  of  backlash.  Remember,  there  was  a  modern  warfare  where  you  had  to
[518.78 - 520.42] SPEAKER_04:  take  down  the  airport  shooter.
[521.24 - 526.40] SPEAKER_02:  There  was  like  people  were  like,  this  is  fucked  up.  This  is  too  far.  And  then  other  people  were  like,  no,  this  is  important.
[527.04 - 530.80] SPEAKER_04:  Well,  it's  definitely  not  important.  It's  fucking  crazy.
[531.08 - 533.08] SPEAKER_02:  That  mission  was  awesome.  That  mission  was  crazy.
[533.32 - 534.64] SPEAKER_04:  I  don't  know.  I  feel  like  it  is  important.
[534.74 - 540.80] SPEAKER_03:  If  you  just  sit  there  and  do  that  for  hours  and  hours  and  hours,  I  do  feel  like  if  the  real  thing  happened,  you  might  on  some  level  be  more  prepared.
[540.80 - 543.98] SPEAKER_04:  Well,  that's  exactly  the  problem  because  in  this  mission,  you  are  the  shooters.
[544.28 - 544.98] SPEAKER_03:  Oh,  no.
[545.54 - 548.34] SPEAKER_04:  First  half,  you  walk  around  with  a  machine  gun  in  a  fucking  airport.
[548.82 - 549.30] SPEAKER_03:  You're  an
[549.30 - 550.02] SPEAKER_02:  airport  shooter?
[550.28 - 552.78] SPEAKER_04:  Yes.  It's  a  tough  one.  And  the  mission  is.  Wait,  I
[552.78 - 552.90] SPEAKER_03:  don't
[552.90 - 554.78] SPEAKER_02:  remember  that  part.  The  first  part,  you  were  the
[554.78 - 560.08] SPEAKER_04:  shooter?  No,  you're  not.  You're  literally  just  going  through  killing  every  civilian.
[560.70 - 561.50] SPEAKER_02:  Oh,  my  God.
[561.80 - 564.00] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  It's  really  bad.  All  right.  I  forgot  about
[564.00 - 564.74] SPEAKER_02:  that.  That
[564.74 - 567.08] SPEAKER_04:  might  be  too  far.  It's
[567.08 - 567.34] SPEAKER_02:  nuts.
[568.30 - 569.54] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah,  that's  not  good.  That's
[569.54 - 572.94] SPEAKER_04:  why  Call  of  Duty  hit  the  old  switcheroo.
[573.06 - 573.40] SPEAKER_03:  Zombies.
[573.58 - 573.58] SPEAKER_04:  It's
[573.58 - 573.76] SPEAKER_03:  like,
[574.26 - 576.16] SPEAKER_04:  I'm  a  purple  woman  sliding.
[576.80 - 577.14] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah.
[577.40 - 578.48] SPEAKER_04:  All  right.  I  see  it.
[578.70 - 579.02] SPEAKER_03:  They
[579.02 - 580.54] SPEAKER_04:  hit  the  peak.  They're
[580.54 - 586.12] SPEAKER_03:  like,  we  made  the  top  of  the  mountain.  Although  in  Grand  Theft  Auto,  you're  essentially  doing  that  anyway.  Grand  Theft
[586.12 - 589.22] SPEAKER_04:  Auto,  there's  rumors  that  there  is  a  pride  parade  in  the  city.
[589.64 - 590.00] SPEAKER_03:  No.
[590.92 - 593.46] SPEAKER_04:  Fellas,  don't.  Don't.
[594.02 - 597.86] SPEAKER_03:  Don't  let  me  catch  you.  Don't,  dude.  Those
[597.86 - 600.10] SPEAKER_04:  videos  are  going  to  be  fucking  chaos.
[601.80 - 604.12] SPEAKER_03:  Oh,  no.  Every
[604.12 - 606.16] SPEAKER_04:  single  person  that  downloads  the  game.
[607.46 - 611.40] SPEAKER_03:  Straight  to  the  parade.  I  do  feel  like,  to  be  fair.  No
[611.40 - 615.18] SPEAKER_04:  way.  No  way.  And  there  you  go.  What  would  happen?
[616.06 - 619.40] SPEAKER_03:  To  be  fair,  it's  time  the  hookers  in  GTA  get  a  break.
[619.82 - 620.80] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah.  True.  The
[620.80 - 622.76] SPEAKER_03:  hookers  are  going  to  be  watching  and  be  like,  thank  fucking
[622.76 - 623.14] SPEAKER_04:  God.
[623.58 - 624.64] SPEAKER_03:  Finally,  we  can  relax.
[625.20 - 625.88] SPEAKER_04:  They're  next.
[626.46 - 626.90] SPEAKER_03:  Once
[626.90 - 627.02] SPEAKER_02:  you
[627.02 - 631.78] SPEAKER_04:  get  five  stars  from  the  fucking  parade,  you're  headed  straight  to  the  fucking  strip  club.
[633.72 - 635.32] SPEAKER_02:  They're  really  doing  that.  You  think  I  forgot  about  you?
[635.32 - 635.32] SPEAKER_04:  That's
[635.32 - 635.82] SPEAKER_02:  so  funny.
[636.44 - 641.44] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah,  they're  doing  that.  That's,  uh...  I  wonder  if  they'll  make  it  off  limits.
[641.68 - 646.66] SPEAKER_02:  I  think  they're  going  to  reel  this  game  back.  Grand  Theft  Auto  makes  more.  It'll  get  hacked.  That  game  gets  hacked,  too.
[646.66 - 647.66] SPEAKER_04:  I  think  they're
[647.66 - 652.40] SPEAKER_02:  going  to  reel  this  one  back.  I  was  friends  with  this  guy,  Laszlo,  that  was  one  of  the  top  developed  guys.
[652.70 - 653.32] SPEAKER_04:  He  was  the  guy  that
[653.32 - 655.32] SPEAKER_02:  put  us  all  into  the  games  and  shit.  And  he
[655.32 - 655.50] SPEAKER_04:  left.
[655.78 - 655.78] SPEAKER_02:  I
[655.78 - 656.66] SPEAKER_04:  forgot  you  were  in  Grand  Theft  Auto.
[656.92 - 657.46] SPEAKER_02:  Yeah,  five.
[657.72 - 658.30] SPEAKER_04:  That's  fucking  awesome.
[658.42 - 658.70] SPEAKER_02:  It's  wild.
[658.92 - 659.34] SPEAKER_04:  That  is  awesome.
[659.46 - 660.08] SPEAKER_02:  Faces  in  it.
[660.62 - 661.30] SPEAKER_04:  The  mocap
[661.30 - 662.26] SPEAKER_02:  was  insane.
[662.80 - 664.68] SPEAKER_04:  Damn.  That  mocap's  a  nightmare.
[664.98 - 665.98] SPEAKER_02:  It  would  suck.  How
[665.98 - 668.36] SPEAKER_04:  much  did  you  feel  like  it?  You  must  have  looked  nuts  in
[668.36 - 681.00] SPEAKER_02:  a  mocap.  By  the  way,  it  was  old  school  mocap.  It  wasn't  this  fucking  Harrison  Ford  shit  where  they  put  blue  dots  on  your  face.  I  had  a  helmet  on  with  a  camera  in  my  face.  It  was  crazy.  You  had  to  wear  a  frog  suit,  like  Green  Man.
[681.16 - 683.04] SPEAKER_03:  What  was  your  role?  What  did  you  play?
[684.00 - 697.30] SPEAKER_02:  There's...  When  you  go  into  the  safe  house  or  the  safe  house,  whatever  it's  called,  there's  a  TV  and  there's  shows  you  can  watch.  And  there's  a  show  with  the...  Whoever  the  action  star  is  in  that  series  that's  like  the  Stallone  type.
[697.32 - 697.64] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah.
[698.74 - 708.88] SPEAKER_02:  It's  a  reality  show  about  him.  And  I  play  his  new  agent.  And  I'm  like  this  coke  head.  And  it's  me  and  him.  We  did  like...  We  shot  like  30  minutes.  We  shot  a  full  episode  of  this  thing.
[709.04 - 709.20] SPEAKER_03:  Whoa.
[709.46 - 718.68] SPEAKER_02:  And  it's  in  the  game.  And  then  we  went  back  and  did  additional  content  later  that  never  got  released.  That  I  just  had  to  sign  crazy  NDAs  about.  I'm  not  allowed  to  talk  about  it.
[718.74 - 719.44] SPEAKER_03:  Whoa,  that's  awesome.
[719.66 - 720.46] SPEAKER_02:  But  anyway,  it
[720.46 - 721.60] SPEAKER_03:  was  awesome.  It  was  fucking...
[721.60 - 721.60] SPEAKER_02:  He  just
[721.60 - 721.80] SPEAKER_03:  fucks
[721.80 - 722.34] SPEAKER_02:  you  in  this.
[722.34 - 723.12] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah.
[724.10 - 725.32] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
[726.56 - 728.76] SPEAKER_03:  This  episode  is  brought  to  you  by  Viore.
[729.42 - 738.10] SPEAKER_04:  So  there's  a  lot  of  sports  out  there.  Obviously,  you've  got  basketball,  baseball,  and  football.  But  then  there's  running,  tennis,  MMA,  climbing,  yoga,  pickleball.
[738.44 - 741.76] SPEAKER_03:  And  that's  before  you  get  into  all  the  different  ways  you  can  train  and  work  out.
[742.06 - 751.98] SPEAKER_04:  Right.  But  the  good  news  is  that  you  only  need  one  pair  of  shorts  for  all  of  it.  The  core  short  from  Viore.  That's  right.  Wear  one  pair  of  shorts  all  the  time.
[751.98 - 752.82] SPEAKER_03:  That's  all  you
[752.82 - 752.88] SPEAKER_04:  need.
[753.08 - 753.08] SPEAKER_03:  The
[753.08 - 753.28] SPEAKER_04:  workout.
[753.68 - 754.92] SPEAKER_03:  The  core  short.  That's  all  I  do.
[754.94 - 756.16] SPEAKER_04:  No  one's  going  to  think  you  stink.
[756.40 - 758.62] SPEAKER_03:  No,  not  at  all.  You  can  get  two  pairs.  You  can
[758.62 - 760.00] SPEAKER_04:  switch  them  every  day.  Or  just  do
[760.00 - 764.64] SPEAKER_03:  morning  and  afternoon.  The  core  short  is  the  short  that  started  it  all  for  Viore.
[764.88 - 765.24] SPEAKER_04:  Mm -hmm.
[765.38 - 767.92] SPEAKER_03:  Fitness  versatility.  One  short  every  sport.
[768.28 - 768.62] SPEAKER_04:  Mm -hmm.
[768.98 - 773.96] SPEAKER_03:  Guys,  they're  ideal  for  fitness  running  and  training,  but  also  stylish  and  comfortable.  That's  important.
[774.22 - 775.64] SPEAKER_04:  That  is  important.  I  want  to  be  stylish.
[775.90 - 777.34] SPEAKER_03:  I  want  to  be  stylish  and  comfortable.
[778.78 - 779.72] SPEAKER_04:  Matt,  are  they  soft?
[781.34 - 782.40] SPEAKER_03:  They're  soft.  They're  pretty  soft.  A  lot
[782.40 - 782.90] SPEAKER_04:  of  Viore  stuff.
[784.42 - 785.24] SPEAKER_03:  How  much  do  they  weigh?
[785.44 - 785.58] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah.
[785.88 - 787.94] SPEAKER_03:  Pretty  lightweight.  The  core  shorts.
[788.22 - 790.28] SPEAKER_04:  Is  it  only  three -way  performance  or  how  many?
[790.78 - 793.72] SPEAKER_03:  I'd  say  it's  pretty  multiplex.
[794.52 - 795.76] SPEAKER_04:  Is  it  a  four -way  performance  stretch?
[796.10 - 807.56] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah.  Oh,  yeah.  Yeah,  definitely  the  fourth  dimension.  I  can  stretch  backwards  in  them  for  sure.  Also,  the  core  is  a  little  tougher.  Some  of  their  stuff  is  like  borderline  erotic.  If  you  feel  my  shorts  right  here,
[807.74 - 808.98] SPEAKER_04:  I'm  actually  wearing  them  right  now.
[809.10 - 809.10] SPEAKER_03:  Don't
[809.10 - 809.32] SPEAKER_04:  make  me.
[809.46 - 810.56] SPEAKER_03:  I'm  actually  wearing  them  right  now,  dude.

[839.36 - 842.58] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah,  that's  awesome.  They  had  stand -up  in,  was  it  four  or  five?
[842.80 - 845.30] SPEAKER_02:  Yeah,  I  think  Burr,  no,  Gervais  is  doing  stand -up.
[845.36 - 846.18] SPEAKER_04:  I  think  Cat  Williams.

[848.88 - 850.90] SPEAKER_04:  it  actually  as  a  comedian  in.  That's  pretty  crazy.
[851.02 - 852.22] SPEAKER_02:  Yeah,  but  he's...
[852.22 - 852.22] SPEAKER_04:  You  can  bring
[852.22 - 852.36] SPEAKER_02:  your
[852.36 - 853.54] SPEAKER_04:  gun  in  there  and  you  can  shoot
[853.54 - 854.46] SPEAKER_02:  Cat  Williams.
[855.80 - 857.22] SPEAKER_03:  Bro,  stand -up  special,
[857.46 - 859.74] SPEAKER_04:  GTA  animated.  That'd  be  awesome.  A
[859.74 - 865.56] SPEAKER_03:  special  where  you're  just  in  a  mo -cap  suit,  you  perform  live  in  a  mo -cap  suit,  and  they  recreate  it  in  GTA  V,  and  people  can  just  shoot
[865.56 - 865.94] SPEAKER_04:  people.
[866.66 - 867.02] SPEAKER_03:  Really?
[867.32 - 868.00] SPEAKER_04:  That's  what  I'm  saying.
[868.14 - 869.12] SPEAKER_03:  That's  fucking  sick.  It  literally
[869.12 - 869.48] SPEAKER_04:  did  that.
[869.62 - 870.20] SPEAKER_03:  That's  awesome.  You  can
[870.20 - 872.38] SPEAKER_04:  walk  in.  There's  a  comedy  club.  It's  Ricky  Gervais.
[872.54 - 873.04] SPEAKER_02:  That's  awesome.
[873.20 - 873.54] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah.  Yeah.
[873.78 - 878.36] SPEAKER_02:  It  was  nuts  when  we  did  it  because  it  was  like  early  days  of  that.  Not  early,  but  early
[878.36 - 879.74] SPEAKER_04:  days.  Yeah,  you  should  do  that  now  again.
[880.10 - 880.42] SPEAKER_02:  Yeah.
[880.62 - 881.20] SPEAKER_04:  And  just  put  it  out
[881.20 - 881.34] SPEAKER_02:  as
[881.34 - 882.34] SPEAKER_03:  a  game.  Yeah,  true.  Just
[882.34 - 882.60] SPEAKER_02:  be  like,
[882.68 - 883.42] SPEAKER_04:  this  is  my  special.
[883.64 - 884.80] SPEAKER_03:  You'd  shoot  me.  It's  live.
[884.96 - 885.66] SPEAKER_02:  Yeah,  you  guys  get...
[885.66 - 888.36] SPEAKER_04:  Nobody  hears  the  first  joke  ever.
[889.60 - 904.22] SPEAKER_02:  They  had  this  fucking...  We  were  in  this  green  room,  and  they  had  all  these  plastic  structures,  and  they'd  be  like,  that's  your  car,  so  open  the  door  and  sit  in  it,  whatever.  And  you  would  do  it,  and  then  they'd  be  like,  okay,  come  over  here  and  look  at  this.  It  was  rendering  in  real  time.
[904.42 - 904.56] SPEAKER_03:  Whoa.
[904.88 - 908.56] SPEAKER_02:  So  you'd  walk  over,  and  it  didn't  look  like  it  did  in  the  game,  but  it  was  like
[908.56 - 909.34] SPEAKER_03:  you
[909.34 - 915.12] SPEAKER_02:  getting  into  a  fucking  car  in  a  video  game  immediately.  It  was  crazy.  It  was  fucking
[915.12 - 916.28] SPEAKER_03:  crazy.  Yeah,  that's  awesome.  Dude,  this  is
[916.28 - 918.54] SPEAKER_02:  like  2009.  This  is  a
[918.54 - 919.16] SPEAKER_03:  while  ago.
[919.50 - 944.14] SPEAKER_02:  That's  crazy,  yeah.  But  anyway,  yeah,  the  game  made  $5  billion.  I  got  paid  three  grand.  And  I  remember  calling  Lazlo  and  going,  I  want  a  copy  of  Max  Payne  3.  And  he  goes,  you  fucking  comics,  man.  Always  looking  for  free  shit.  I  go,  your  game  just  made  a  billion  dollars.  You  paid  me  three  grand.  Send  me  fucking  Max  Payne  3  right  now.  And  he's  like,  all  right,  that's  fair,  dude.  Okay,  I'll
[944.14 - 945.02] SPEAKER_04:  send  you  one.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.
[946.18 - 968.44] SPEAKER_02:  When  you  put  it  that  way.  But  I  think  it's  the  point  I'm  ultimately  getting  at  is  I  have  a  feeling  with  his  absence,  I  feel  like  they're  going  to  reel  back  in  this  one.  I  just  don't  think  it's  like  Eminem  saying  like,  look,  man,  time's  changed.  Nobody  wants  this  anymore.  I'm  just  not  doing  it  anymore.  I  feel  like  they're  going  to  pull  back.
[968.46 - 973.06] SPEAKER_04:  Ready  or  not,  it's  kind  of  proven  everyone  wants  it.  Yeah,  that's  a  good  point.
[973.36 - 973.78] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah.  That's
[973.78 - 973.88] SPEAKER_04:  a  good
[973.88 - 975.16] SPEAKER_02:  point.  It  should
[975.16 - 975.44] SPEAKER_04:  be  like
[975.44 - 987.04] SPEAKER_03:  in  Mortal  Kombat.  Then  you  have  to  put  in  a  setting  for  like,  you  should  have  settings.  If  you  want  to  play  kind  of  like,  you  know,  reeled  back  GTA,  you  can  just  hit  a  setting.  If  you  want  to  go  nuts,  you  should  just  be,  you  get  to  be  Hunter  Biden.
[987.34 - 987.46] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah,
[987.52 - 989.36] SPEAKER_02:  there  was  the  blood  code.
[989.60 - 990.84] SPEAKER_04:  Hunter  Biden's  rocking  right
[990.84 - 991.90] SPEAKER_03:  now.  He's  rocking  right  now.
[992.02 - 992.94] SPEAKER_04:  That  would  fire  me  up.
[993.10 - 994.60] SPEAKER_03:  He  might  be,  dude,  he  might  put  his  hat  around.  He's  literally  the
[994.60 - 1001.56] SPEAKER_04:  O 'Connor  man.  He  is.  Did  you  hear  the  way  he  was  speaking?  I've  had  that  conversation  with  O 'Connor  10  million  times.
[1001.56 - 1002.38] SPEAKER_03:  I  saw  the  clip.
[1002.58 - 1010.58] SPEAKER_04:  He's  like,  that  motherfucker  wants  to  fucking  talk  shit.  I'm  like,  damn,  this  is  the  O 'Connor  man.  I  just  fought  him  at  Lala's  for  fucking  10  hours
[1010.58 - 1011.34] SPEAKER_02:  with
[1011.34 - 1011.60] SPEAKER_04:  this
[1011.60 - 1012.66] SPEAKER_02:  exact  conversation.  O
[1012.66 - 1012.66] SPEAKER_04: 'Connor,
[1012.66 - 1014.08] SPEAKER_02:  dude,  is  a  psycho.
[1014.32 - 1014.32] SPEAKER_04:  You're  a
[1014.32 - 1024.80] SPEAKER_02:  fucking  idiot.  O 'Connor  is  a  fucking  psycho.  He's  a  bad.  I've  seen  him  get  angrier.  And  I'm  an  angry  dude.
[1025.06 - 1025.64] SPEAKER_04:  O 'Connor
[1025.64 - 1026.60] SPEAKER_02:  gets  hot,  man.
[1026.98 - 1029.60] SPEAKER_04:  O 'Connor,  yeah.  And  I  know  exactly  how  to  do  it.
[1029.62 - 1030.52] SPEAKER_02:  And  it's  so
[1030.52 - 1030.96] SPEAKER_04:  funny.
[1031.54 - 1046.72] SPEAKER_02:  Dude,  you're  fucking,  you're  Batman,  dude.  Remember  Batman  in  the  Justice  League  comics?  He  had  a  way  to  kill  every  member  of  the  Justice  League  just  in  case  it  went  sideways.  That's  Shane  with  every  one  of  his  friends.  I  know  exactly  how  to  piss  you  off,  dude.  And  I'm  going  to  do  it
[1046.72 - 1047.30] SPEAKER_04:  right  now.
[1047.48 - 1047.48] SPEAKER_02:  No,
[1047.48 - 1047.50] SPEAKER_04:  I'm
[1047.50 - 1047.70] SPEAKER_03:  going  to  be
[1047.70 - 1052.34] SPEAKER_04:  a  comment.  The  O 'Connor  man's  just  the,  I  don't  ever  do  that  really  to  you  guys.
[1054.30 - 1055.94] SPEAKER_03:  You  do  get  the  O 'Connor,  you  get  the
[1055.94 - 1056.54] SPEAKER_04:  comment.  Oh,  comments.
[1058.10 - 1058.98] SPEAKER_03:  It's  really  funny.
[1059.12 - 1060.08] SPEAKER_04:  He  also,  he  knows
[1060.08 - 1067.18] SPEAKER_03:  too,  though.  He'll  feel  it.  You'll  start  hitting  the  buttons  and  he'll  go,  I'm  not  doing  this  with  you.  And  then,  eventually.  You
[1067.18 - 1069.56] SPEAKER_04:  can't,  you  can't.  He  always,
[1069.72 - 1069.88] SPEAKER_03:  he's
[1069.88 - 1071.80] SPEAKER_02:  like,  Shane,  I'm  not  doing  that  right

[1090.28 - 1091.50] SPEAKER_02:  Dude,  we  were  arguing.
[1091.72 - 1091.72] SPEAKER_04:  He  took
[1091.72 - 1091.82] SPEAKER_02:  the
[1091.82 - 1096.74] SPEAKER_04:  Trojan  horse.  He  fell  asleep.  You're  cutting  everybody's  heads  off.  It's
[1096.74 - 1105.16] SPEAKER_02:  over.  Shane  and  I  were  arguing  about  Prince.  I  was  pro  Prince.  Shane  was  anti  Prince.  It  was  our  argument.  O 'Connor  jumped  in.  O 'Connor  got  so  hot.  O 'Connor
[1105.16 - 1111.76] SPEAKER_04:  lost  his  fucking  mind.  But,  hold  on.  Hold  on.  That  was,  you  want  to  talk  about  great,  great  drunks?

[1112.40 - 1112.54] SPEAKER_03:  This
[1112.54 - 1121.68] SPEAKER_04:  was  one  of  the  all -time  drunks.  This  was  coming  back  from  London,  back  to,  back  to  the  United  States.  And  we  had,  like,  a  private  room.
[1121.68 - 1122.18] SPEAKER_03:  Mm -hmm.
[1122.66 - 1125.20] SPEAKER_04:  We  were  flying.  It  wasn't  private.  It

[1125.66 - 1128.22] SPEAKER_04:  jet.  But  they  have  this  thing.  They're  cheap  as  fuck.
[1128.54 - 1128.68] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah.
[1128.82 - 1132.02] SPEAKER_04:  Everybody  should  be  doing  this.  There's,  like,  a  VIP  thing  at  big  airports.
[1132.32 - 1132.58] SPEAKER_03:  Mm -hmm.
[1132.72 - 1133.74] SPEAKER_04:  For,  like,  $1 ,000.
[1134.28 - 1134.56] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah.
[1134.92 - 1139.06] SPEAKER_04:  Where  they  just,  that  you  have  your  own  security.  You  have  your  own  thing.  And  then  they  just  put  you  in  a  room.
[1139.50 - 1139.96] SPEAKER_03:  What?  With
[1139.96 - 1146.54] SPEAKER_04:  free  alcohol.  And  then  they're  like,  guys,  the  flight  got  delayed  by  two  hours.  And  everyone  in  the  room  was  just,  like,
[1147.08 - 1150.56] SPEAKER_03:  oh,  shit.  And
[1150.56 - 1157.84] SPEAKER_04:  we  got,  we  drank  vodka  for  three  hours  and  argued  about  Prince  for  three  straight  hours.
[1158.72 - 1160.22] SPEAKER_03:  And  Okaman
[1160.22 - 1165.98] SPEAKER_04:  was  my  staunchest  ally.  Okaman  went  nuts.  Oh,  he  went  nuts  anti -Prince.
[1166.10 - 1170.22] SPEAKER_03:  He  was  like,  play  one  fucking  song.  Play  one  fucking
[1170.22 - 1175.38] SPEAKER_02:  song.  And  Shane  was  being  like,  appreciate  your  support,  Chris.  You  got  to  back  it  off.
[1175.64 - 1175.96] SPEAKER_04:  Like,
[1176.12 - 1177.34] SPEAKER_02:  you're  going  crazy  right  now,
[1177.38 - 1181.04] SPEAKER_03:  man.  They  should  have  reached  out  to  air  traffic  control.  Like,  we  got  to  get  this  plane  up.  But  this  is
[1181.04 - 1181.72] SPEAKER_04:  a  disaster.
[1181.86 - 1182.18] SPEAKER_03:  We  have  a
[1182.18 - 1183.08] SPEAKER_04:  disaster  on  the  ground.
[1183.20 - 1183.20] SPEAKER_03:  I  think  they  let  me
[1183.20 - 1184.56] SPEAKER_02:  smoke  in  the  fucking  room.
[1184.80 - 1187.94] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah,  we  were  smoking  in  the  room.  It  was.  I  didn't  know  this  existed.
[1188.26 - 1192.86] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah.  Either  did  I.  I  did  it  once.  This  is  the  second  time  I've  done  it.  I  did  it  once  at  JFK.
[1193.28 - 1193.60] SPEAKER_03:  And
[1193.60 - 1195.32] SPEAKER_04:  it  was  the  biggest  waste  of  money  of  all  time.
[1195.62 - 1196.08] SPEAKER_03:  Really?  Just
[1196.08 - 1197.94] SPEAKER_04:  a  woman  met  me  at  baggage.
[1198.42 - 1199.10] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah.  And
[1199.10 - 1207.14] SPEAKER_04:  walked  me  through  and  then  took  me  to  an  airport  lounge.  And  they  were  like.  And  then  she  left.  And  then  they  were  like,  you  can't  come  in  here.  I  was  like,  oh,  shit.  Oh,  that
[1207.14 - 1207.48] SPEAKER_03:  sucks.
[1207.78 - 1207.96] SPEAKER_02:  That
[1207.96 - 1208.16] SPEAKER_04:  sucks,
[1208.16 - 1209.76] SPEAKER_03:  yeah.  The  closest  I  got  to  that.  It  was  just  a
[1209.76 - 1212.46] SPEAKER_04:  regular  lounge.  Did  you  ever  do  someone  in
[1212.46 - 1215.32] SPEAKER_03:  a  wheelchair  at  the  airport?  That's  fucking  VIP  status.
[1215.56 - 1215.76] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah.
[1216.00 - 1220.34] SPEAKER_03:  My  wife  was  super  pregnant.  She  got  the  wheelchair.  And  you  just  go  through,  like,  a  weird  corridor.  It's  awesome.
[1220.46 - 1221.14] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah.  That
[1221.14 - 1224.88] SPEAKER_03:  would  be  a  flex,  dude.  If  you  got  hit  the  regular  airport,  hit  the  chair.  I
[1224.88 - 1225.90] SPEAKER_04:  should  start  hitting  the  chair  anyway.
[1225.90 - 1228.06] SPEAKER_03:  Blank  it.  Blank  it.  Blank  it  over  my  fucking
[1228.06 - 1233.40] SPEAKER_04:  head.  Get  it  like  a  blackjack  dealer  poker  player  visor.  Just
[1233.40 - 1234.60] SPEAKER_03:  get  pushed  through  the  airport.
[1235.06 - 1235.38] SPEAKER_04:  Float
[1235.38 - 1235.38] SPEAKER_03:  through  the  airport.
[1235.38 - 1236.44] SPEAKER_04:  It's  the  fucking  move,  dude.
[1236.68 - 1237.32] SPEAKER_03:  Just  black  out.
[1237.60 - 1241.76] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah.  Just  get  blacked  out.  Start  screaming  about  Prince  from  a  wheelchair.
[1242.38 - 1247.42] SPEAKER_03:  Just  get  the  Stephen  Hawking  set  up  for  when  you're  blacked  out.  Just  blink.  Like,  do  you  want  another?  Do  you  want  some  more  peanuts?  Just  go.
[1248.14 - 1248.46] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah.

[1249.38 - 1249.46] SPEAKER_04:  Yes,  yes,  yes.
[1250.34 - 1252.08] SPEAKER_03:  Tony,  you  should  get  towed.  Just  get  an
[1252.08 - 1256.26] SPEAKER_04:  application.  I'd  be  like,  all  right,  I'll  have  one  more  beer.  Just  walking  up.  Get
[1256.26 - 1259.72] SPEAKER_03:  towed  by  the  cart.  Have  the  guy,  have  the  Egyptian  guy  scream,  get  out  of  the  way.
[1259.72 - 1260.18] SPEAKER_04:  And  you  just
[1260.18 - 1265.86] SPEAKER_03:  get  towed  behind  the  chair.  That  would  be  nice.
[1266.04 - 1267.14] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah.  Or  squat  up.
[1267.34 - 1268.36] SPEAKER_03:  Just  have  like  six  or

[1277.76 - 1282.10] SPEAKER_03:  Isn't  that  insane?  Isn't  that  insane,  though,  that  somebody  could  get  so  fat
[1282.10 - 1282.84] SPEAKER_02:  that  you  just  get
[1282.84 - 1285.44] SPEAKER_03:  VIP?  Oh,  true.  It's  crazy.  It's
[1285.44 - 1285.48] SPEAKER_04:  insane.
[1286.00 - 1290.80] SPEAKER_03:  It's  crazy,  dude.  It's  like  ancient  times.  If  someone  was  super  fat  back  in  the  day,  like,

[1291.40 - 1291.40] SPEAKER_03:  ruler.  Yeah,
[1291.40 - 1297.48] SPEAKER_04:  I  think  if  people  found  like  just  vague  records  of  our  civilization,  they'd  be  like,  they  worshipped  fat  people.
[1297.86 - 1298.22] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah.
[1298.62 - 1301.42] SPEAKER_04:  They  did  everything  for  the  fats.  Dude,  when  I  was
[1301.42 - 1315.28] SPEAKER_03:  reading  about  the  Aztecs,  there  was  one  of  the  guys  that  Cortez  linked  up  with  who  was  like  a  rival  against  Montezuma.  He  was  a  fat  king  and  he  had  servants  literally  hold  his  belly  up  for  him.  So  he  would  come  talking  like,  yo,  we  got  to  fuck  up  Montezuma.  And  then  he  had  two  guys  the  whole  time  just
[1315.28 - 1316.22] SPEAKER_04:  holding
[1316.22 - 1317.60] SPEAKER_03:  his  belly  while  he  talked.  That's
[1317.60 - 1325.20] SPEAKER_04:  what  used  to  be  like  doing  YKWD.  He'd  get  in  there,  there'd  be  five  dudes  just,  yes,  Bobby,  yes.

[1326.68 - 1327.52] SPEAKER_04:  a  fucking  punk.
[1328.44 - 1329.24] SPEAKER_03:  It's  crazy.
[1331.58 - 1332.90] SPEAKER_04:  Yes,  Bobby,  get  him.

[1345.88 - 1346.64] SPEAKER_03:  It's  the  best.
[1347.74 - 1352.52] SPEAKER_02:  Wait,  wait.  Speaking  of  dudes,  it'll  throw  down  the  drama.  Soty's  another  one.  Soty  will

[1421.14 - 1421.46] SPEAKER_04:  the  ladder
[1421.46 - 1421.46] SPEAKER_02:  down.

[1513.04 - 1518.26] SPEAKER_03:  You  didn't  go  to  the  ground.  You  could  have  went  to  the  ground.  That  was  honorable.  I  had  to  get,  I  mean,  it  was  too  good  of
[1518.26 - 1518.60] SPEAKER_04:  a  fight,
[1518.74 - 1518.80] SPEAKER_03:  dude.
[1518.92 - 1518.92] SPEAKER_04:  It
[1518.92 - 1519.66] SPEAKER_03:  was  such  a  good  battle.
[1520.04 - 1521.72] SPEAKER_04:  Every  kick  that  landed,  people  in  the  room  were  like,
[1522.08 - 1522.36] SPEAKER_03:  oh.
[1524.26 - 1525.44] SPEAKER_04:  Oh,  he  didn't  get  me.  He  didn't  get  me.
[1527.32 - 1533.26] SPEAKER_02:  Oh,  dude,  that's  fucking  good.  Did  you  ever  have,  did  you  ever  have  somebody,  like,  I've  had  friends,  like,  literally  punch  me.
[1533.76 - 1536.44] SPEAKER_03:  Probably,  if  I  had  ever,  probably  there's  been  fights.  Well,
[1536.46 - 1541.64] SPEAKER_02:  we  were  younger,  but  it's  like,  like  when  we  were  16  in  Street  Fighter  2  on  Super
[1541.64 - 1542.32] SPEAKER_03:  Nintendo  was
[1542.32 - 1548.90] SPEAKER_02:  huge,  whatever.  Yeah,  I  remember  I  was,  I  would  play  with  my  friend  Kevin,  and  if  you  beat  him,  he  would  literally  punch  you.  That's
[1548.90 - 1549.16] SPEAKER_03:  so  funny.  And
[1549.16 - 1551.36] SPEAKER_02:  he  would  go,  I  could  beat  the  fucking  shit  out  of  you  in  real  life.  Big  Jay's
[1551.36 - 1552.82] SPEAKER_04:  one,  that's  a  scary  one.
[1553.02 - 1553.34] SPEAKER_02:  Really?
[1553.58 - 1559.02] SPEAKER_04:  He  doesn't  get  violent,  but  that,  like,  it  changes  the  day.  If  you  beat  him  in  a  game,  it  changes.
[1559.70 - 1560.98] SPEAKER_02:  Like  he  gets  a  pouty?  The  rest  of  the
[1560.98 - 1562.26] SPEAKER_04:  day.  A
[1562.26 - 1562.42] SPEAKER_02:  little.
[1562.64 - 1562.64] SPEAKER_04:  Like
[1562.64 - 1562.98] SPEAKER_02:  sad?
[1564.02 - 1566.08] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah,  he'll  get  you  there.  He'll  start  getting  you.
[1566.76 - 1567.50] SPEAKER_02:  He'll  go,  what  the
[1567.50 - 1571.20] SPEAKER_04:  fuck  are  you  being  mean  to  me  for?  Oh,  yeah,  I  forgot  I  beat  you  in  Xbox  last  week.
[1573.56 - 1578.40] SPEAKER_03:  I'm  also,  I'm  a  sore,  I'm  a  sore  winner  too.  I'm  better  with  it  now.  When  I  was  younger,  I  was,  I  was  always  bad
[1578.40 - 1578.82] SPEAKER_04:  at  video  games.
[1578.82 - 1578.82] SPEAKER_03:  You
[1578.82 - 1580.18] SPEAKER_04:  are  a  sore  winner.  So  when  I  win,
[1580.36 - 1588.18] SPEAKER_03:  I  would  do  a  thing  where  I  would  like  just  sit  there,  I  grab  what  I,  I  have  a  drink  next  to  me  and  just  go,  and  just  do  shit  like  that.
[1588.30 - 1588.34] SPEAKER_04:  And
[1588.34 - 1589.44] SPEAKER_03:  like,  dude,  for  real,  stop  doing  that.
[1589.52 - 1589.60] SPEAKER_04:  I'm
[1589.60 - 1589.60] SPEAKER_03:  like,
[1589.68 - 1589.96] SPEAKER_04:  this  is
[1589.96 - 1590.90] SPEAKER_03:  just  water,  I'm  thirsty.
[1591.04 - 1593.34] SPEAKER_04:  I'm  just  drinking.  Maybe  you're,  maybe  you're  upset.
[1593.62 - 1600.66] SPEAKER_03:  And  then  start  being  like,  yeah,  you  know,  it's  just  what  I  do.  I  kind  of  go  low  and  you  kind  of  go  high  to  me  and  it's  just,  shut  the  fuck  up,  dude.
[1601.58 - 1613.72] SPEAKER_02:  The,  I,  I  never,  I  think  the  only  time  I've  ever  beaten  you  in  a  video  game  was  when  we  played  Mortal  Kombat.  Every  other  game  we've  ever  played  each  other  against,  you've
[1613.72 - 1614.14] SPEAKER_04:  beaten  me.
[1614.24 - 1614.24] SPEAKER_02:  You
[1614.24 - 1616.64] SPEAKER_04:  guys  are  out  doing  activities.  MK  is  the  Achilles
[1616.64 - 1617.30] SPEAKER_02:  heel  for  sure.
[1617.86 - 1618.70] SPEAKER_04:  I'm  working  on
[1618.70 - 1619.92] SPEAKER_03:  it.  You've  got  better  than  MK.  No.
[1620.20 - 1620.22] SPEAKER_02:  I'm
[1620.22 - 1620.22] SPEAKER_04:  working
[1620.22 - 1620.34] SPEAKER_03:  on
[1620.34 - 1620.84] SPEAKER_04:  it.  No.
[1621.24 - 1627.02] SPEAKER_02:  Bring  it,  dude.  It's  coming.  Bring  it.  I'm  fucking  swinging  swords  with  Conan  right  now.  It's  coming.  Oh  yeah,
[1627.12 - 1629.32] SPEAKER_04:  you  downloaded  the  fucking  game  and  started  playing  it.  Yeah,
[1629.46 - 1629.60] SPEAKER_02:  fuck.
[1629.94 - 1634.90] SPEAKER_04:  You  actually  said  to  me,  this  is,  that's  bullshit.  This  was  an  insane
[1634.90 - 1635.50] SPEAKER_02:  thing  to  say
[1635.50 - 1636.54] SPEAKER_04:  to  me.  No,  that's  bullshit.
[1636.64 - 1636.64] SPEAKER_02:  I
[1636.64 - 1637.70] SPEAKER_04:  downloaded  the  game  and  you  go,
[1637.94 - 1642.60] SPEAKER_02:  no,  I  downloaded  the  game  and  you  go,  don't  get  good  at  it  because  I'm  not  going  to  play  it.  And  I'm  like,
[1643.50 - 1644.84] SPEAKER_04:  oh,  I  can't  have  fun  because
[1644.84 - 1647.30] SPEAKER_02:  you're  not  going  to  play  it.  no,  no.  It  was  crazy.
[1648.48 - 1657.72] SPEAKER_04:  Hold  on.  This  is  game  stealing.  This  is  almost  worse  than  French  stealing.  Coming  over,  going,  oh,  the  new  Mortal  Kombat's  good  because  we  were  playing  it  together
[1657.72 - 1658.18] SPEAKER_02:  and  having  a
[1658.18 - 1658.38] SPEAKER_04:  nice
[1658.38 - 1659.30] SPEAKER_02:  time  because  we  were  just

[1659.92 - 1660.14] SPEAKER_02:  Yeah.
[1660.58 - 1662.30] SPEAKER_04:  Go  home  and  download  it  and  practice.
[1662.64 - 1664.28] SPEAKER_02:  No,  I  want  to  play  it.  That's  game  stealing.
[1664.28 - 1669.12] SPEAKER_04:  That's  coward  shit.  That  game  sucks.  The  game  sucks  by  yourself.
[1669.60 - 1676.40] SPEAKER_02:  No,  it  doesn't,  dude.  You  have  not  played  with  Conan,  man.  It's  fucking  righteous,  dude.  It's  righteous.
[1676.76 - 1677.58] SPEAKER_04:  That  game.  When  you
[1677.58 - 1682.62] SPEAKER_02:  win  a  match,  he  goes  like  this  and  they  recreate  the  poster  from  Conan  the  Barbarian.
[1682.76 - 1683.04] SPEAKER_04:  It's  fucking
[1683.04 - 1683.08] SPEAKER_02:  awesome.  How
[1683.08 - 1687.76] SPEAKER_04:  many  times  do  you  get  to  see  that?  I've  never  been  told.  Seven  dozen.  You  never  get  sold.  No,
[1687.88 - 1697.82] SPEAKER_02:  it  never  gets  sold,  dude.  It  never  gets  sold  and  the  guy  doing  his  voice  is  good.  T -1000's  awesome.  Yeah.  Quest  mode
[1697.82 - 1699.30] SPEAKER_03:  sucks  in  Mortal  Kombat.
[1699.44 - 1700.12] SPEAKER_02:  Yeah.  One  player
[1700.12 - 1700.64] SPEAKER_03:  blows.
[1701.06 - 1701.60] SPEAKER_02:  One  player  sucks.
[1701.92 - 1709.34] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah.  One  player,  I've  tried  it.  It  fucking  sucks  but  training,  just  being  in  the  dojo,  training  and  just  being  like,  yeah,  let's  pop  it  on.
[1709.34 - 1709.82] SPEAKER_04:  What
[1709.82 - 1709.82] SPEAKER_03:  are
[1709.82 - 1710.42] SPEAKER_04:  you  guys  playing?
[1710.56 - 1712.78] SPEAKER_03:  17  hit  combo.  You're  like,  what  the  hell  the  fuck  did  I  do  that?
[1713.92 - 1714.82] SPEAKER_04:  Combos  are  nuts.
[1715.40 - 1717.18] SPEAKER_02:  The  trailer  for  the  new  movie  looks  all  right.
[1717.92 - 1719.14] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah,  I  like  the  more.
[1719.14 - 1720.52] SPEAKER_04:  Really?  I  disagree.
[1721.26 - 1725.28] SPEAKER_02:  I  like  that  at  the  end  when  Scorpion  flew  in  and  they  did  the  get  over  here.
[1725.30 - 1726.20] SPEAKER_04:  I  didn't  make  it  to  the  end.
[1726.38 - 1726.92] SPEAKER_02:  Oh,  really?
[1727.18 - 1730.32] SPEAKER_04:  I  turned  it  off  with  like  30  seconds  or  like  20  seconds.
[1730.46 - 1732.76] SPEAKER_02:  I  don't  think  he's  a  good  Johnny  Cage.  I
[1732.76 - 1733.34] SPEAKER_04:  think  it's  miscast.
[1733.68 - 1733.68] SPEAKER_02:  He's
[1733.68 - 1735.44] SPEAKER_04:  playing.  I  think  so  too.  Carl
[1735.44 - 1735.80] SPEAKER_02:  Urban
[1736.76 - 1737.12] SPEAKER_04:  from,
[1737.34 - 1738.28] SPEAKER_02:  what's  he  on?  The  Boys?
[1738.48 - 1739.10] SPEAKER_04:  The  Boys,  the  Boys,  yeah.
[1740.16 - 1744.66] SPEAKER_02:  He  doesn't  look  like  Johnny  Cage.  Like  Johnny  Cage  was  kind  of  modeled  after  Jean -Claude  Van  Damme.
[1744.72 - 1744.88] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah.
[1745.76 - 1753.16] SPEAKER_02:  And  like,  Johnny  Cage,  he  should  be  prettier.  Like  he's  not,  Carl  Urban's  not  pretty  enough.  The  whole  cool  thing  about  Johnny  Cage  is  that  he's  like  a  pretty
[1753.16 - 1753.62] SPEAKER_03:  boy.  He's
[1753.62 - 1753.62] SPEAKER_02:  a  pretty
[1753.62 - 1755.40] SPEAKER_03:  boy.  But  he's  a  badass.  Punches  you  in  the  dick.
[1755.40 - 1759.08] SPEAKER_02:  Yeah.  It  literally  should  be  like  Ryan  Felipe.  You  know  what  I  mean?
[1759.46 - 1759.54] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah.
[1759.72 - 1762.44] SPEAKER_02:  Wait,  not  Ryan  Felipe.  Ryan  Gosling.  I've  never  heard
[1762.44 - 1763.48] SPEAKER_04:  him  called  Ryan  Felipe.
[1764.38 - 1765.62] SPEAKER_02:  No,  Ryan  Felipe's  a  dude.
[1765.80 - 1766.38] SPEAKER_04:  No,  I  know,  but
[1766.38 - 1766.80] SPEAKER_02:  I
[1766.80 - 1767.58] SPEAKER_04:  always  thought  it  was  Felipe.
[1768.86 - 1771.04] SPEAKER_03:  No,  I  think  it's  Felipe.  I  thought  it  was  Felipe  too.
[1771.52 - 1771.84] SPEAKER_04:  Really?
[1772.78 - 1775.52] SPEAKER_03:  They  should  have,  they  should  have  Kevin  Spacey  as  Johnny  Cage.
[1775.96 - 1776.68] SPEAKER_04:  Hold  on  a  second.
[1777.14 - 1777.50] SPEAKER_03:  By

[1780.80 - 1783.08] SPEAKER_04:  He's  a  listener  to  the  podcast.  Felipe's  gonna  hear  that.
[1783.34 - 1783.66] SPEAKER_02:  Oh,  really?
[1783.78 - 1783.94] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah.
[1784.28 - 1787.30] SPEAKER_02:  Yeah.  I'm  a  big  fan  of  Felipe.  The  way,  the  way  of  the  gun.

[2200.62 - 2202.46] SPEAKER_02:  Like  it  just  cleared  up  immediately

[2203.08 - 2205.14] SPEAKER_02:  got  in  the  sun  and  there  was  like  a  saltwater  pool.
[2205.34 - 2205.68] SPEAKER_04:  Bro,  I

[2223.78 - 2225.88] SPEAKER_02:  Does  it  look  like  a  red  spot?  Like  sunburn?  The
[2225.88 - 2226.40] SPEAKER_04:  first  one  does.
[2227.60 - 2227.96] SPEAKER_02:  There's
[2227.96 - 2232.68] SPEAKER_04:  a  Harold  patch  that  comes  first.  I  was  just  looking  at  the  mirror  and  I  just  had  a  big  red  mark  here.
[2232.92 - 2233.06] SPEAKER_02:  Okay.
[2233.40 - 2234.42] SPEAKER_04:  And  I  was  like,  all  right,  whatever.
[2234.50 - 2234.78] SPEAKER_02:  I  don't  give
[2234.78 - 2238.08] SPEAKER_04:  a  fuck.  And  then  started  multiplying.  It  was  just  all  over  me.
[2238.22 - 2238.70] SPEAKER_02:  Oh.  But  it  was
[2238.70 - 2244.78] SPEAKER_04:  only  where  sun  doesn't  get  you.  So  it's  from  your  knees  to  your  elbows.  Like  it  was  just  where  you  wear  clothes.
[2245.02 - 2245.14] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah.
[2245.48 - 2247.04] SPEAKER_04:  And  then  my  family  and  I  went  to  the  beach.

[2262.62 - 2263.50] SPEAKER_03:  It's  an  organ  on  your  body.
[2263.70 - 2268.20] SPEAKER_02:  You're  right  about  dermatologists  though.  Like  a  dermatologist  is  a  little  bit  like,  yep,  that's  pretty  gross.  You  know,  here's  some
[2268.20 - 2269.04] SPEAKER_03:  cream,  you  know,
[2269.14 - 2274.04] SPEAKER_02:  like  in  the  cream,  the  reason  you  can't  do  it  for  more  than  two  weeks  is  because  a  lot  of  it's,  it  will,  it  thins  your  skin.
[2274.20 - 2276.44] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah.  And  you  buy  what  I've  had  with  the
[2276.44 - 2277.00] SPEAKER_02:  creams.  Use

[2292.44 - 2293.74] SPEAKER_04:  me.  Ball  skin  goes  the  craziest.
[2294.06 - 2295.68] SPEAKER_03:  Oh,  ball  skin.  When  it  goes,
[2295.90 - 2296.36] SPEAKER_04:  the  absolute,
[2296.36 - 2297.58] SPEAKER_03:  when  that  stuff  goes  down,  you
[2297.58 - 2297.58] SPEAKER_04:  get

[2299.30 - 2299.48] SPEAKER_03:  that's
[2299.48 - 2300.00] SPEAKER_04:  three  years.
[2300.18 - 2301.18] SPEAKER_03:  It's  the  exact,  that's  not
[2301.18 - 2302.54] SPEAKER_04:  going  away  for  three  fucking  years.

[2303.60 - 2304.38] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah.  It  sucks.
[2304.54 - 2305.02] SPEAKER_03:  I  actually
[2305.02 - 2308.24] SPEAKER_04:  dealt  with  an  armpit  rash  for  an  entire  year  last  year.  What
[2308.24 - 2310.34] SPEAKER_03:  were  you  using?  A  new  deodorant  with  alcohol?  it  was  the
[2310.34 - 2313.72] SPEAKER_04:  same  old  deodorants.  I  just,  uh,  it  was  almost  like  I  got  jock  itch.

[2315.04 - 2316.60] SPEAKER_04:  And  it  just  lingered.
[2316.78 - 2318.88] SPEAKER_02:  I  think  there's  nothing  worse  than  an  armpit  rash.
[2318.96 - 2319.42] SPEAKER_03:  Cause  you
[2319.42 - 2320.84] SPEAKER_04:  have  to  put  deodorant  on  it
[2320.84 - 2321.68] SPEAKER_02:  and  it  burns
[2321.68 - 2321.94] SPEAKER_04:  and
[2321.94 - 2322.06] SPEAKER_03:  it
[2322.06 - 2322.48] SPEAKER_04:  itches
[2322.48 - 2324.56] SPEAKER_02:  so  bad.  And  you,  you,  I
[2324.56 - 2336.28] SPEAKER_04:  was  plowing  through  it.  I  was  just  putting  fucking,  uh,  antifungal  cream  on  it.  Filming  tires.  It  was  while  we  were  filming.  It  went  from  the  summer  into  when  we  were  filming  time.
[2336.30 - 2337.48] SPEAKER_03:  It  was  a  nightmare.
[2338.04 - 2338.68] SPEAKER_02:  I  don't  wear

[2338.68 - 2338.88] SPEAKER_02:  I
[2338.88 - 2339.66] SPEAKER_03:  don't  wear  deodorant.
[2339.66 - 2340.32] SPEAKER_04:  I'll  put  it  on
[2340.32 - 2342.44] SPEAKER_03:  like  once  every  now  and  again.
[2342.56 - 2343.38] SPEAKER_02:  Do  you  not  sweat  though?

[2374.70 - 2379.96] SPEAKER_03:  I  would  do  a  little  like  loop  de  loop  tracks.  The  one  time  it  did  get  out  of  control.  And  I  was  like,  fuck,  fuck,  fuck.  How  did  your  parents  not  know  you
[2379.96 - 2381.78] SPEAKER_02:  were  lighting  the  carpet  on  fire?

[2407.22 - 2412.86] SPEAKER_03:  is  awesome.  Your  dad  gets  drunk  when  you're  little.  Although  the  first  time  I  did  get  scared  because  I  read  a  book  in  the  library  saying  like,  it  was  all  about
[2412.86 - 2414.44] SPEAKER_04:  like,  drunk  and  hitting  your
[2414.44 - 2427.84] SPEAKER_03:  mom.  So  it  was  like,  the  book  was  called  like,  why  does  dad  hit  mom  when  he  drinks?  It  was  something  like  that.  First  time  I  saw  my  dad  drunk,  I  was  just  like,  he's  beating  the  fuck  out  of  my  mom  right  now.  And  I  was  just  a  little  coward.  I  just  sat  in  my  room.  Like,  I  hope  he  doesn't  go  too  hard  on  her.
[2428.10 - 2429.42] SPEAKER_04:  Yeah.  He  didn't
[2429.42 - 2430.64] SPEAKER_03:  at  all.  He  was  so  friendly.
[2431.56 - 2432.94] SPEAKER_04:  He  sat  on  the  steps  and  cried.
[2433.14 - 2434.84] SPEAKER_03:  Yeah.  I  should
[2434.84 - 2435.78] SPEAKER_04:  go  in  there.
[2435.90 - 2443.66] SPEAKER_03:  He  was  just  literally  like,  he  would  come  in  and  be  like,  dad.  I'd  be  like,  well,  dad,  don't  look  at  beat  mom.
[2444.40 - 2444.76] SPEAKER_04:  Oh,
[2444.86 - 2445.06] SPEAKER_02:  that's
[2445.06 - 2445.86] SPEAKER_04:  great.  Drunk
[2445.86 - 2448.46] SPEAKER_02:  dad.  That's
[2448.46 - 2449.18] SPEAKER_03:  super  friendly.
[2449.80 - 2450.92] SPEAKER_04:  Phil  is  still  that.
[2451.18 - 2452.32] SPEAKER_03:  He  gets,  he
[2452.32 - 2452.96] SPEAKER_04:  comes  home.  He  goes,
[2454.52 - 2454.84] SPEAKER_03:  fuck
[2454.84 - 2457.46] SPEAKER_04:  yeah.  Then  you  see  him  in  the  morning.  He's  like,  how  are  you?
[2459.54 - 2460.72] SPEAKER_03:  You're  a  fucking  punk.
[2461.40 - 2465.96] SPEAKER_04:  Oh,  you're  hungover.  You're  being,  I'm  not  hungover.  He's  never  been  hungover  once.  Hitting
[2465.96 - 2472.76] SPEAKER_03:  a  girl  with  hungover  is  very  funny.  I've  done  it  before.  I'd  be  like,  you're  just  hungover  and  being  fucking  great.  I'm  not  even  hungover  at  all.  It's  like,  yeah,  you're
[2472.76 - 2475.26] SPEAKER_04:  a  little  edgy.  Everybody  loves  denying  a  hangover.
[2475.50 - 2476.16] SPEAKER_03:  Hey,  it's  crazy.
[2476.46 - 2483.14] SPEAKER_04:  Everybody's  favorite  thing  to  do  is  go.  I'm  not,  you  know,  what's  crazy.  I  feel  pretty  good.  There  you  go.  I'll  tell  you  guys  right  now,  I'm
