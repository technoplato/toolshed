Using `chunk_length_s` is very experimental with seq2seq models. The results will not necessarily be entirely accurate and will have caveats. More information: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/20104. Ignore this warning with pipeline(..., ignore_warning=True). To use Whisper for long-form transcription, use rather the model's `generate` method directly as the model relies on it's own chunking mechanism (cf. Whisper original paper, section 3.8. Long-form Transcription).

This deprecation is part of a large refactoring effort to transition TorchAudio into a maintenance phase. The decoding and encoding capabilities of PyTorch for both audio and video are being consolidated into TorchCodec. Please see https://github.com/pytorch/audio/issues/3902 for more information. It will be removed from the 2.9 release.
