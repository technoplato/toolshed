# Gemini Anti-Gravity Debugger

This tool watches the internal state files of the Gemini Anti-Gravity IDE to help you understand what the AI is "thinking" and "doing" under the hood.

## How it Works

The IDE uses a file-based state system with atomic writes:
1.  **Thinking**: It writes thoughts to `.tmp` files.
2.  **Saving**: It renames `.tmp` files to `.pb` (Protocol Buffer) files to save state atomically.
3.  **Refining**: It creates `.resolved` files (e.g., `task.md.resolved.3`) as it iteratively improves its output.

This tool watches `/Users/laptop/.gemini/antigravity` and instantly copies these ephemeral files to the `captures/` directory before they are deleted or overwritten.

## Usage

1.  Start the watcher:
    ```bash
    cd apps/gemini-debugger
    npm start
    ```
2.  Interact with the Gemini IDE (ask questions, create tasks).
3.  Check the `captures/` directory to see the raw state files.

## Captured Files

*   `*.tmp`: Temporary state writes (often the most interesting intermediate "thoughts").
*   `*.pb`: Binary protocol buffer states (conversation history).
*   `*.resolved`: The final or intermediate markdown outputs generated by the AI.
